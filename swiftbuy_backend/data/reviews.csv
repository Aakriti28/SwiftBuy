9,3,AKS3GULZE0HFC,B00007GDFV,"I had used my last el-cheapo fake leather cigarette case for SEVEN YEARS. It still closed completely but the plastic made to look like leather was literally falling off, so it was time for a new one. Cigarette cases for kings size cigs are not easy to come by these days I discovered, but I was thrilled to find this one on Amazon. It was a great price, REAL LEATHER, and even had the cool zipper pouch on the back. I was so excited to get my case and toss that other one! Well, within THREE DAYS one of the gold clasps literally broke off! I couldn't believe it! I tried to super glue it back on and was not successful. so, I still use the case but it doesn't close securely. I was very disappointed that my $3.00 plastic one lasted 7 years and this real nice leather one lasted 3 days!!

Purchased one black one brown, black one used most and has no centre seam down front lighter or rear coin pockets. Brown one has (pointless) decorative centre seam (as usually illustrated) front and rear. Front seam stitching has no reinforcing at lighter pocket opening. Looks likely to give trouble sooner rather than later. Leather is good and solid. Size is spot on for regular (84mm) packs of 20 (after a little use).

It was very well made, the leather was soft, not stiff or cheap looking. I loved the little front pocket that kept my lighter handy and easy to keep up with. There is even a small zippered pocket for change or whatever else. I was very pleased with it. Unfortunately, I had not read the description well enough and I discovered this case DOES NOT fit the 100's. It was such a nice case that I gave it to my daughter rather than return it.

You must either be very good with a iron and starch or have these pressed for $1.50. I recommend the latter but my wife does an ok job ironing these. I own about 20 Paul Frederick shirts and I like them all. You cant beat the quality especially if get them on sale like I do.

When they arrived, I still found it hard to believe. But these are excellent quality socks that have held up well through heavy use and lots of washings. The three pair are serving well alongside their far more expensive drawer-mates. It's hard to imagine someone getting excited by a pair of socks, but these are worth getting excited about. I agree that a color other than gray would help to stretch these socks further in my wardrobe, but for the price... I ain't complainin'!","09 19, 2004",3868,319

I placed an order for a friend of mine who runs a soup kitchen in Poplar Bluff Missouri. It was an order of about 60 pairs of these socks which probably seemed pretty strange to the people at Sportsman's Guide, but they sent them anyway. I didn't think much about it until I got an e-mail from Joni, the lady in Poplar Bluff, that the socks had arrived.
She told me that you would think that the socks were made of gold the way the people at her free store responded to them. They had NEVER seen such socks!! They were soft and they were thick and warm. Most of them had never even heard of wool socks.
Now I don't think twice about wool socks because I love them but it gave me real pause to think that there were people who had never even heard of such a wonderful thing. These people couldn't believe that someone would just give them something this good. Yes, this good.
So if you're thinking of buying some of these why don't you get an extra pair or two and give them to someone who needs them. It will be an education, I promise, and your gift will reward you many times over when you experience the gratitude such a small thing can evoke.","01 29, 2004",12917,685

200,5,A20XJOQ1UAIGS6,B00015VKT4,"My first review but I have to say......About 15 years ago I developed an allergy to nickle (earrings, necklaces, belt buckles, buttons, bracelets!) and stopped wearing most jewelry. I have to tape over my belt buckles or any metal that contacts my skin and was diagnosed as severely allergic by my doc after allergy skin test. About a year ago I got my ears repierced with my daughter so we could have fun wearing jewelry and have tried every kind of hypo allergenic earring I could find: Studex, Sterling Silver 925, Surgical Steel, 14k gold, and had allergic reactions to all of them if worn for even an hour. Studex that my ears were pierced with was the worst! Bleeding, red itchy swollen earlobes a few weeks to heal in between each time I wore earrings! Searched Amazon for an hour to find these and did some research. They work as promised! I had to force them through (holes had partially closed) and had some initial healing for about 2 weeks. Now I'm wearing them 24/7 no problems! It's a first and really wonderful. I will get more. This size is a bit small for a main earring so I will get the next size up. THANK YOU.","06 4, 2010",6864,869
201,5,A1SET3T90T5HM1,B00015VKT4,"It is refreshing to wear these earrings because they don't make my earlobes swell up. My ears are too sensitive for ""sensitive"" earrings and I was about ready to give up and resign myself to clip earrings. Fortunately I found these. They are more expensive than other earrings due to the metal, but well worth it. It's like my ears don't even know they're there :) .","01 8, 2010",18769,871

I decided to try these but honestly didn't expect there to be a difference.  Within hours of wearing these my ears had no discomfort at all.  Again, my ears weren't red or swollen but just had a very minor ache.  I'd recommend these to people even if it's not the last resort to wearing earrings.

I also really like the small simple style so these were perfect for me anyway.  I've found it very difficult to find earrings I like in stores because they all seem so big and overbearing.  I'm sure that I will end up buying more pairs of these in a similar style and definitely give preference to titanium earrings.","01 7, 2009",7336,778

205,5,A2QERMCJKRIVEK,B00015VKT4,"I have only owned these earrings a few weeks, but I'm quite pleased with them.  Before buying these, I had been completely unable to wear earrings for many years.  My earlobes would swell, turn red, and bleed immediately after inserting even ""hypoallergenic"" earrings.  I've tried other brands, such as Simply Whispers, which I really wanted to love, but I simply couldn't wear them.  I'd given up and given away most of my earrings and hadn't bought or tried any earrings for a few years.

When these first arrived, I had trouble inserting them because my earlobes had almost grown closed, and I traumatized my ears a bit.  Over the next several days, I removed them at night, then irritated my ears again when I reinserted them in the morning.  Finally, I decided to just leave them in and allow my ears to heal, and that has worked just fine.  Now my ears have healed, and I haven't bothered to remove the earrings for a couple of weeks.

I noticed that in a review for one of the other styles, the reviewer had two complaints: that the ad appeared misleading in that it looked like you were purchasing three pairs of earrings, and that the 3mm size was tiny.  So take note:  you are ordering just one pair of earrings, and the 3mm (mini) size earrings are very small - take a look at a ruler to get an idea - but they provide an understated bit of sparkle.

I highly recommend these for people with metal allergies - I'm planning to get another pair.","06 2, 2006",10998,241

The two gloves (sized L/XL) are two different sizes.  One glove fits fine, but the other is much smaller (the fingers don't fit all the way on one side).  Because of this bad fit, he wore them for the first time this morning and the smaller glove is already ripping.  No good.","12 27, 2011",10306,748
212,4,A3S9JZQ1D8O8OJ,B0002L2LGI,"1.13.12 UPDATE: I've now been using these gloves through all of December and half of January and I continue to recommend them. Many of my runs have taken place in temperatures within the 20s, and while the gloves are not winter gloves, they are working out. My hands are cold as I start my run and the tips of my fingers do sting initially, but after about half a mile or a mile, I've warmed up enough that my hands become comfortable. In fact, I think if I were wearing anything heavier, the warmth of the gloves might become too much. These allow me to go for 8-mile runs without feeling like I have to take them off. As long as you're okay starting your run with slightly cold hands, these could be for you.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I've been using these gloves on and off for about a month now, and so far I've found them to be a great purchase. I usually go for runs around 5 a.m., and this has allowed me to test them out in temps that have resided in the mid-30s. So far, so good. They do the job. If I remember, I'll post an update once the weather gets even colder.

My only concern is the fit. I'm an average size guy, and there's something a little uncomfortable about the way they fit, as if the fingers could've been cut lower, that makes me think I'd have an issue with them if I were a taller guy with bigger hands. That being said, I'd purchase these again if I had to do it all over again. At this price point, you can't beat them.","12 8, 2011",15206,21

221,3,A2GA1CASBF5YKM,B0002PR25Y,"Over quite a few years I've bought and worn Silver Forest jewelry, especially earrings, and used to get so many compliments on them.  Unfortunately, their aesthetic has changed over time, away from what made their pieces special and interesting.  Many of their designs used to be kind of contemporary and unusual, with the multiple, individually moving components, contrasting materials and textures, and subtle color palettes creating a unique feel.  They were sort of sophisticated but relatively affordable.  Some designs veered more towards conventionally pretty or delicate, while some were more like abstract modern art pieces, but all were pretty well made and special.  These days, it seems they go more towards an overly ""pretty"" aesthetic, too overwhelmingly using motifs such as lace, flowers, tear-drop shapes, and such, all made with less interesting materials.  Such things are not bad, necessarily, but the variety is gone, and their pieces are just not very special anymore.

277,3,ACTT5UPTY0SV1,B0002Z1JNK,Kinda ivory white..Not purest white I expected. Nice shape boot. Small in calf area l could have done  size larger but I squeeze into them.,"07 12, 2014",13891,95
278,3,AHAWKYIV2S1G4,B0002Z1JNK,"I am a size 12 mens... so according to all the reading I have done, I'm supposed to order women's boots 2 sizes larger.  When I ordered these, I got a 15... and I probably could wear a 16.  So...  these things run pretty small.  They will be used for a costume getup (no, it's not a drag outfit!).

Another thing I quickly discovered... maybe this is just because I have never worn knee high boots or heels of any kind before...  but when you stand flat and do not move, the ""plane"" of the bottom of the boot is wrong.  First, the toe plate... it's not so much curved as it is a slight ""V"" shape.  It is possible to stand on your toes, simply by leaning forward and shifting your weight a little.  When you lean back again, the heel comes back down to the ground and your toes roll up a little.  This may be difficult to imagine, and again, it may just be because I have not worn heels before.  But it seems like it should have a flatter sole.

The 'patent leather' is VERY thin.  Not that I expected much, it's a $50 boot, not a $500 one.  In a way this is good because it stretches to stay tight around my huge calves.

I can tell it's going to take a while to get used to walking in them, but I'll get comfortable with them in time.

EDIT:  I ordered a 16 and it fits better.  So... 4 sizes larger than my men's size rating.","02 14, 2014",11884,535

Quality of construction in BOTH Haiti & Egypt very good

292,4,A2V2URLB31HG59,B00062NHH0,"I bought the 3-pack of black v-neck CK's via Amazon in May'09.  I purchased men's size ""Medium"" based on the fact that I bought the same 3-pack last year in size ""Large"" and the fit was bigger than I wanted.  I am 5'10"", 195lbs and usually wear a size ""Large"" in most men's tops.

In terms of sizing I was looking for a fit that is slightly snug versus too baggy (as the Larges were for me) so now that I have the size Mediums they are working out much better for my preference (especially since I've noticed they also tend to stretch out a bit over time).  Bad news is I have 6 of these tshirts clogging up my dresser drawers now, good news is since I have the Medium and Large sizes I can gain a few pounds and I'm still good to go (beer me).

I do agree with some other reviewers that CK tshirts do tend to be thin material and they aren't your typical stand alone t-shirt you can show off about town.  They are good tshirts under another piece of clothing, as pajama top, or working around the yard.  I actually like the fact that CK v-necks are thin because they are very comfortable to wear for incognito usage.

Style-wise a good looking t-shirt with nice looking v-neck shape.

Overall: 4 out of 5 stars. High marks for looks and comfort for my intended usage, minus 1 star for the slightly strange sizing causing inventory buildup in my dresser drawers.

I hope you found my review helpful.","05 13, 2009",7209,498

It is a trite complaint but it did seem odd that all 3 shirts had the imprinted name and information (instead of the bothersome tag) and the printing was off center and slanted downhill???

536,5,AR626UUFUOSYR,B00062NHH0,"I bought this for my brother to wear as an undershirt for when he has to wear dress shirts or dressy sweaters, and he loves them.  His favorite part about these shirts is that you can barely feel the material in comparison to all of his cotton shirts.  So, they're definitely light/thin material.  He would never wear them as a regular shirt unless it's in a casual setting (e.g. to bed).

Regardless, they work GREAT for wearing under buttoned dress shirts or dressy sweaters, and I'll definitely be buying the white ones for him soon enough.

Oh, as for the fit, I obviously can't personally comment on it, but for him the XL worked great.  He's all around a huge guy (height, weight, and his shoulders) and while he normally wears XLs, sometimes they fit too tight on him due to his shoulders and neck.  This XL fit perfectly with a little room to spare, so if you're a bigger person with regards to your height and shoulders, get your normal size, otherwise definitely size down.","12 28, 2014",5412,954

595,5,A3117ZNJXDOZM8,B00062NHH0,"These shirts are great V-Neck's that fit perfectly, are comfortable, and look great!

They can be used as a black under-shirt, if ever needed, but I love to wear these as every day shirts.  The nice cotton design is comfortable and washes great. After many washes I still find the shirt to be comfortable and fit the same way as always (the first wash/dry might make it - like all shirts - shrink a little).

These are some of my favorite shirts to wear, and I wear them all the time.

They fit as you would expect, I purchased medium (as I purchase medium shirts always) and it fit as it should.  At first it was a little too big, but after the first wash/dry it shaped properly and fits perfectly now.

The material is thick, and it doesn't' feel cheap at all, while it is nice and soft and great for sleeping in too (your significant other will love the softness of the material!).

When I purchased them, they were on sale and a great value - but even at regular price these shirts are definitely a great buy and can be worn as an every day shirt, as a black under shirt, or as a nice comfortable at home/night shirt.  I have recommend these (and the white versions, as undershirts) to my friends and purchase new ones every so often when I lose them, or people take them!

Lastly, they are made to last! I have had some of these for more than a year (coming up on almost two years, actually) and they still look great and fit perfectly -- after about a year I usually retire them to night shirts and get new fresh ones (as I tend to stain them here and there and wear them so much that I like to purchase fresh ones to wear out -- don't don't let that make you think they don't last, I could absolutely still wear them out if I wanted to!).

Calvin Klein is a great brand, and makes great V-Necks (in all colors!).","11 12, 2014",1578,542

716,4,A2PH0RC79INW6U,B00062NHH0,"I love CK t-shirts. They are very soft and comfortable. It is hard to determine if the size is ""true."" With vanity sizing these days, every brand seems to be different. I typically wear an XL in most brands (6'0"" tall and 215 lbs - 44R suit size). I usually get XL to compensate for my beer belly, but these were quit large and baggy for me personally with my dimensions. I then ordered size Large because they were such a great price and find that they fit much better. Still roomy enough not to grip my belly too much and fit my frame much better. The V-Neck helps draw attention away from that awful looking beer gut. Further, the length is great as I am fairly tall in the torso and have a problem with most brands because they are not long enough. They did not shrink on the initial two washes/dries, but in my past experience with CK t-shirts, after repeated washing/drying they do tend to shrink a bit and lose their softness (around 1 year of use) - which is probably typical of most all brands and the repeated abuse of machine washing and high heat drying.","08 8, 2014",6296,406

854,5,A2LFL9ZJBALCVT,B00062NHH0,"Update:

I'm about to place my 3rd order of these shirts. I ordered 9 over one year ago, and 9 one year prior to that. I am one of those guys who just sweats a lot. To ensure the shirts the world sees stay alive for longer, i wear these guys underneath. If I were to rate these shirts lower for any reason, it would be that the collars at the side of my neck wrinkles, But that's specific to me and my body, because my neck is larger than the body size the shirt is built for. At the V of the neck, the shirt maintains it's structure, rests comfortably and it's so thick that I notice it, even when it's under a shirt, a tie and a v-neck sweater. I had a thought of buying another shirt to see if these could be beat, but I can't see the reason to risk it. I realized today that I may be over the clock on buying these and I was. I told myself to replace them every 6 months and it's been a year. Did these shirts lose their color? After a year of my use, and zero bleach, yes. But I don't think there is a single white shirt on the planet that can endure a year with me, my sweat, my abuse and my cleaning techniques. The color fading is the only reason I remembered I needed to replace them.

OLDER Revew:
I wear white undershirts every day to extend the life of my expensive collard shirts. These guys soak up my sweat, and wash very easy. They also have delivered on being white for longer than quite a few other shirts I have owned before them. I'll be reordering more of these when they wear out, but for now, they're holding up quite well.","01 3, 2014",18155,252

Obviously I paid a lot less for these at Costco; about half what amzn is asking for them, but I'm willing to pay the higher price as these are well worth it from a quality stand point.

The first few I had no problem with, but after that, the length varied drastically with each new package I got. The variance between shortest and longest runs about 4 inches. Within a package, they are consistent, but not when comparing those from different packages. This is a problem when using under dress shirts, as the short ones can come untucked very easily and bunch above your pant waistband, or if wearing solo, you get to show off your stomach whenever you raise your hands above eye level. If you get a package and after a wash they seem shorter than they should be, exchange for a different package to try again.

Aside from length, the quality seems pretty consistent, though I've had a few sloppy ""lumpy"" shoulder seams now and again. For the price, you cannot complain too much for this.","08 1, 2012",12921,353

I'm surprised that others say the shirts run big since I'm 5'5"" and 160 lbs, and I wear a medium... just like my regular shirts.

The only real gripe I have (besides the high price) is that there is a tag on the shoulder that itches me. There's no tag on the neck, presumably to prevent an itchy neck, but then they put the tag on the shoulder. Kinda lame, but no biggie.","02 27, 2012",8369,366

This is pretty close to just right - just low enough that you can't see it, but not so low that it's WAY under the neck line of your dress shirt (brooks bros iron free, top button left unbuttoned).

It is adjustable to any hat size. The hook pin needs some consideration. I pin the hook to the other end of the band and make sure the point is tucked inside the band and not pinned all the way through the band. I make sure it is tight enough it doesn't fall off when flip it onto my head or I set my hat down upside down on the table.

Because, they do look costume-y. But for 5 dollars... they are a good deal. Especially if it is for a costume, or you just wanna add another pair to your collection. I would recommend these, just because of the low price. It can't hurt to buy them. They may not be my favorite pair but I will surely still use them occasionally.

1100,3,A33OESCADFH3AU,B00066G516,"I bought these for a Halloween costume and for that purpose, they worked just fine. The foot is made out tights-like material and slips on easily. The ruffle is pretty, but oddly doesn't actually make a full circle- it just kind of overlaps at a random point and the ends aren't even finished, so it's a little bit scraggly. I guess that the nylon-style foot led to some sweating, because the bottoms made the dye from the inside of my shoes absorb into the sock- I washed them, but now the bottoms are blue. The shoes were cheap costume shoes, so I can't really blame that on the sock, but if you want the bottoms to stay white, beware colorful shoes. I thought I might wear them with ankle boots in a non-costume outfit, but they kept sort of slinking into my boot and with the scraggly edges, I wasn't crazy about looking like my feet were unraveling all day. I give them three stars, but I would just buy them if you have a one-night costume need and then toss them.","08 9, 2014",3781,988

Nice enough for giving as a gift. The ring itself is very pretty. I think the amber nuggets look a bit plastic but that is the nature of amber especially in small nuggets.

I specifically bought it to wear on my index or middle finger, I'm glad I did because its a little bulky for me to be wear on the ring finger.  I haven't tried it as a thumb ring, yet.  The day I ordered the ring I got an email saying it had been shipped.  I received the ring the next day!  Bonus!  Great ring and fast delivery.","12 9, 2009",2763,959
1138,5,A2SEJKLK7ZU2KI,B000673JT6,"This was my favorite ring. I lost it. I hope some day I will find it but it has been missing for quite a while.
The ring itself is a bit thick, but that's the only negative thing I can think of. The stones are bigger than the rings I normally wear, but not too big. It's not easily adjustable, but I consider that to be a good thing. Rings that adjust easily also wear easily.
It reminded me of planets. It was like wearing planets on my finger.

EDIT 10/27/2012:

I FOUND IT! I FOUND IT! I JUST FOUND IT A FEW MINUTES AGO! I thought I had lost it in a hotel room four years ago but it must have actually fallen off when I was packing away some old baby clothes!

1139,3,A36X3K71XWDQ3T,B000673JT6,I bought this ring a year ago. The design is pretty unique and attractive. You won't be wrong with size because the band adjusts easily. I'd love it if the band would be thinner. The thick round band ruins the impression from this ring and makes wearing it uncomfortable. I still wear it occasionally because the ring matches almost any clothes.,"11 17, 2009",3051,275

The band is a bit thicker than ideal, but it's not so thick that you won't want to wear it.  I do find that the smaller stones don't look as prominent in real life as in the pictures online for some reason.  Because of these small issues, it gets 4 instead of 5 stars, although a significant price drop could gain that 5th star back.  I'm glad that I have this ring as part of my jewelry collection.  It's pretty and elegant and unique.  It goes with all different outfits, and people notice it.","09 13, 2009",5154,902
1142,4,A36ZMH3TKA3BO1,B000673JT6,"This is a very unique ring. The colors are beautiful. I would have given it 5 star if it was not too bulky. My fingers are short so it kinda makes it chubbier. I bought this knowing it was bulky or big, but now that I am wearing it, it does look big. Will post a pix so you can judge for yourself before buying it.","06 5, 2009",12516,301

I just got the ring today and I am so pleased with it. I think perhaps the style isn't for everyone but that's a very good thing! I don't want the same jewelry as everyone else ;)","03 25, 2009",2379,77
1150,5,A2HGY9RSW5MF0W,B000673JT6,"I received this item for Christmas and was very pleased. It is very bold and moderately large, but I do like things like this sometimes. I love having the different types of amber (very pretty). Since it is a bigger ring, I would suggest you get this for an index or middle finger (unless you won't be wearing another ring on the same hand). I'd also not wear it right next to another ring as the silver band could get scratched. Size is pretty true, but the band is mildly adjustable - I was able to open the band a bit with some well-applied pressure (not easy, but possible). If you need to adjust this and are afraid of damage, take yours to a jeweler.

I also have the earrings that match.","03 12, 2009",15864,644
1151,5,A274JPXV6DRB6L,B000673JT6,"The ring is pretty much as pictured (I assume amber stones will always vary slightly in color, inclusions, and clarity). As others have remarked, it is substantial (perhaps 8-10 gage), so if your fingers do not taper slightly toward the base, you might be uncomfortable.  The quality and level of finish look excellent to me. I think the price is great for what you're getting--you're probably not going to find something like this at the mall, and certainly not at this price. I love the design because it doesn't look like most other silver pieces you see--a rep from the company told me their pieces are designed and produced in Europe.

But I really want to comment on the customer service--it is exceptional!  I got my ring as a gift and it arrived Christmas Eve. Day. I don't know if it was the ""open"" nature of the ring or just a goof but it was too big for my finger, and the stones were already angled such that their mounts were touching, so I was nervous about adjusting it myself. I called up expecting to leave a message (because you don't exchange through Amazon, and they don't have a formal RMA/tracking process, which made me nervous--basically you return it with a letter explaining why) but not only did someone answer the phone, they also answered some questions and set up the exchange without having received the too-large one back first. I got my replacement ring on the 30th and I am very happy!","12 30, 2008",10745,602

It was shipped quickly and packaged carefully, but the hat was a disappointment. I ordered a size M and this clearly was not the same M as the camel hat. Also the inner band (grosgrain ribbon) was so stiff, it was uncomfortable. It didn't seem to be of the same high quality of the other hat I have. I returned the hat.

1284,5,AY3H4M9XPFBF9,B0006HB4XE,"Every once in a while, you find finely crafted silver-work at a ridiculously low price and Gem Avenue is one of those rare finds.  I've bought several of their sterling silver chains, including 2 box links, and the quality exceeded all my expectations in each case.  The chains are sturdy, yet maintain their smooth flexibility over time. There is no ""play"" between the links and, though all are fine guage, even the thinnest has a heft that just feels ""expensive"" (kind of like the sound and solid feel of the closing of an expensive car door).  The clasps easily slide into their housing and the spring is taut yet easy to manage with no ""hanging"".

  I personally own only 1 box link chain, one my kids bought me about 10 years ago in a little specialty shop. It was just the right size for me (about 1/16th"" thick link), heavy, and cost $150.00 at the time.  I know, I swallowed my tongue, too.  But it was a very special celebration and came from their hearts with a little help from Mom.  Definitely a stretch on our budget but they felt the chain was important (and I bring it up as a comparative price for fine Sterling 10 years ago). But afterward I learned that there were roving silver artists who sold their work for whatever was necessary to build their business.  We just had to trip over them if we found them at all in this city or that.  Certainly, today you can find cheaply priced silver chains any number of places but, likely as not, you end up with a cheaply constructed chain, possibly even an overlay or plating, links that kink or break, clasps that don't quite ""seat"" properly or fail altogether.  Gem Avenue is the smooth ride on tarmac after a juddering of a day driving over rock-strewn.  These craftsmen take obvious pleasure and pride in their silver-work and it does show.  And to beat it all, they're pricing this fine sterling as if it was costume jewelry.  Oh, and they thoughtfully toss in a nice little jewelry box for each chain purchased.  Why spend so much time reviewing a few silver chains?  Heaven knows if there were problems with the products we'd see postings in those CAPITAL LETTERS with which some express their fury that something was not to their liking.  When a company obviously cares about their products and seems to see each silver chain as a representative of their company, as this company appears to, the suits need to know that the people doing the actual creative work are doing a cut above and that brings back repeat and new customers via referral and ""through the grapevine.

You will be quite happily surprised with what you buy here. Always a fine experience.

Very Best Regards,

1286,5,A3QN0CZAONQH7Z,B0006HB4XE,"I ordered two of the 18"" silver box chains.  First, they arrived in record time (I ordered from Gem Avenue) and each were packaged securely and boxed separately. The chains are exactly what I was hoping to receive.  They are sturdy without looking cheap (and actuallly look very expensive).  They hang nicely and the clasp looks well made.  I have two silver pendants that I like to wear often so it was important to get a chain for each that would withstand daily wear.  Additionally, I have long hair which can sometimes be problematic when wearing chains.  My hair can get caught in a clump near the clasp or I can inadvertantly break the chain when brushing my hair.  I chose the ""box"" type chain and this type of clasp for these reasons as it's the strongest chain available while still looking dainty.  I'm very pleased with both the quality and the price.  I tried to get the same kind of chain at our local department store and it was twice as much.  You won't be disappointed!","02 9, 2009",13587,766

I could not find the chain I was looking for.  Finally, I decided to look on Amazon and at first didn't see anything I was interested in.  I went back and looked on Amazon again the next day and saw a thin box chain, but I didn't know what a box chain looked like and the pictures only showed but so much.  So, I decided to wait.  The next day, I went to work and one of my co-workers was wearing an ""O"" pendant on a thin box chain like the one I saw online.  So, I ran home during lunch that day and went on Amazon to buy the chain.  I was so worried I wasn't going to find a chain that could be delivered to my house by Christmas.  Finally, when I almost gave up, out of all the box chains and sellers on Amazon, there was only one seller, Gemavenue, who's last acceptable order date for the holidays was still within the time limits.  So, I bought their box chain and it was perfect because I was able to choose the length I needed and it was thin but sturdy, like I had been looking for.  I asked for express shipping and ordered it on a Thursday and Christmas was on Tuesday.  The chain arrived that Saturday.  I was so thrilled when it arrived.  It was the right length and had a pretty shine to it.  My mom opened it on Christmas morning along with the pendant and was so surprised.  She loved it.  It was perfect!","01 7, 2008",16348,356

The display case has plenty of room between the watches and the glass.  There is even enough room, both on the pillow and between the pillow and glass, to show off pocket watches.  This case shows off your watches very nicely.  Even my el-cheapo timex watch looks good in this case.

If I had to find something lacking, I would have but one VERY MINOR suggestion.  I think each watch compartment should be just a tad bit deeper or longer so that I could store any watch band links right with the appropriate watch.  I'm able to do that now, but not in a way the hides the extra links very well.  Like I said, a very minor complaint, not even big enough to lose a star to.

1495,5,A2RLC53CG8EV7Y,B0006YY7XQ,"I LOVE THESE BOOTS!!!  I have been riding for almost 15 years, and I can honestly say, that entire time I would long for good warm boots in the winter!!  I would dread getting off at some points because I knew my toes were going to throb the minute they touched the ground!  I do alot of outdoor riding, even in the winter months, and living in Northeast Pennsylvania you NEED a great pair of winter boots.  The older I got, the more I wanted durable, warm boots that were also comfortable enough to wear around the barn.  These are those boots!!  My toes stay warm even during the coldest months of winter and even during a trail ride!  They do feel a tad snug the first few times until they break in, but after that, they are wonderful.  I would recommend these boots for anyone who is looking for a durable, stylish WARM pair of winter boots!!

UPDATE APRIL 2014:

I JUST had to order another pair!  They lasted me the past 3.5 years and up until about Mid-January/Early February they were still keeping my feet considerably warmer than my warm season paddock boots.  They did start to crack and the soles were coming completely away from the rest of the boot, but I am at the barn 4-5 times a week, sometimes riding 2 or more horses a day.  They DO take a few rides to break in and they are a bit bulkier than your average paddock boot b/c of the insulation but I personally am not a fan of too small of an iron so I have had no issue with them becoming stuck in my irons.  And believe me, my trainer is big on ""drop your irons!"" and I have no problem getting my feet out or back in them.  I also don't lace them all the way up, I leave one out until they get really nice and broken in until I can do that, or my heel doesn't get as far down.  I had actually ordered a pair of Ariat Bossard Insulated Paddock Zips and sent them back b/c they were ridiculously stiff and tight.  Promptly ordered my old go too's and am happy I did because I got them in time to break them in before this winter season was over so no need to worry about that next year!

Update: Work Wear Savings, the company through which the hat was purchased, sent me a return label the same day I called to say the hat was too small. They would send me a large hat when the other had arrived at their returns dept. After over 2 weeks, I had not had any email update. I called the company, learned they had received the returned hat, but that a large hat would not be available until July 14. My complaint: Why did they or Amazon not notify me by email?

I must say that without a doubt this is the most comfortable, and definitely the coolest hat I've ever worn. Love the CoolMax headband.  Plus if you get dirt on it as I did, picking it up with dirty gloves on, It's easy to clean.  I used a wet soft bristle tooth brush with a little mild detergent, brushed the dirt away and let it air dry.

Checking their return policy I found that I would have to pay for the return shipping fee which was almost half the price of the hat itself. I decided to keep it as a working hat when I do my yard work. Few days later I received an email from their customer service asking me about how pleased I was with their product. I told them I wasn't pleased with the condition of the hat, but decided not to return due to high return shipping fee. To my surprise they sent me next day a prepaid UPS label with which I returned the hat requesting for an exchange. Yesterday I received the exchange. This time they packed the hat snuggly inside a box, which was packed inside another larger box with packing paper. Although it took long time to receive the exchange their customer service is superb.

I contacted the vendor and asked them if they could expedite the shipment with the vendor, something I do routinely with my customers.  I was told they'd try.  I contacted their vendor who told me they would be shipping the items to Sportsman on the 13th.  I contact Sportsman indicating I would be leaving on the 21st and needed the item delivered the 20th and if they couldn't promise that delivery to cancel the order if it hadn't shipped by the 17th.

On the evening of the 17th they called and asked if I still wanted the item,  yes but i need it the 20th.  No problem  -- today i get a shipment notice indicating the item will be delivered the 23rd 2 days after i leave.  I don't know if i'll get the item before I leave but to pay 30% of the items cost and be told they cannot expedite the freight after they advertised it as a stock item is poor service, based upon the support i've received i'm not sure i'll be a return customer.

disappointed with amazon and sportsman for not factually indicating the stock status of item,  I understand that their computer systems may not be up to date but you don't find that out until after you place your order, and honestly I have had good experiences with Amazon until now.

Order best size for yourself per sizing chart, but hats may vary enough to require a different size. But don't let that frustrate you worth the patient when you get right fit.

It looks like a fedora, not a sun hat.  And as to doing its job of sun protection, it is very good.  The brim keeps sun off of my face and neck, areas where I have had to have squamous cells removed. My body temperature is cooler with the hat on than off. The open mesh allows heat to escape and for any breeze to cool my head.
My only possible caveat: the mesh is a fairly open weave. If one is bald and must keep sun from the crown of the head, then it could be a problem.  The top of the hat is solid and will protect from the noonday sun. The mesh would only be an issue for early/late sun coming in at an angle.","07 11, 2013",3434,82

Baseball hats work, but they only keep the sun off of whatever direction the bill is facing and being a solid lid, they make my head even sweatier than it would be normally.

I started looking around for a hat that would address all those shortcomings and everywhere I looked, I kept seeing ""Henschel Breezer"".  So, more digging led me to Amazon and all the reviews of said hat.  The reviews were good, the price was right and the best part is, made in America.

Ordered it and as with all things Amazon, it arrived on time and packaged perfectly to protect it.  I've used it every weekend and numerous other times in the aforementioned heinous heat and humidity and it has performed flawlessly.  The sweatband keeps the sweat out of my eyes, the brim keeps the sun off my face and neck and the mesh keeps the top of my head nice and cool.  In essence, this hat rocks!","06 30, 2013",2794,12

I am fair skinned and wanted a wide-brimmed hat to protect my face, neck, and ears from the sun. The sizing is pretty much spot on (measure your head accurately before ordering) and the hat was very comfortable for an entire day's wear. We spent a lot of time in San Jose and Santa Cruz where the temps were in the 80s and a lot of sun. The hat kept my head cool, wicked the sweat, and I didn't get burned. I did use sun block, but worried less about re-application every 80 minutes on my face, ears and neck than I did for my arms and legs.

I haven't needed to wash the hat yet, but will take the necessary precautions to try and quickly dry the brim due to it having a wire inside. I hope to use this hat for several summers.","06 21, 2013",16191,204

But now the sizes have changed.  My large always fit like a glove, the new one in large arrived packed very nicely in a big box but the hat was huge on me.  I returned it for a medium.  It arrive in a very small box ""Pre-Crushed"" if you will.  I would have returned it for that reason alone but it was so small that it hurt to force it on my head.  Not happy with Henschel ""quality control"" or the shipper's packing. I will continue my hunt for this style hat elsewhere.","07 4, 2012",15856,613

I do, and in the summer spend a good amount of time outside and on the water where the sun's rays really start to cook you.  I can also vouch the the keeper strap will keep your hat with you and not floating away somewhere.

This hat is crushable, breathable and after 1 years use, looks as good as the day it arrived.  Plus this is a quality product made here in the U.S. of A.","03 3, 2012",8369,366

It is nice and lightweight, yet durable.  And it fits perfectly, shading the sun while reducing sweating.  And of course, it can be folded up and retain its shape.  My only regret is that it's not quite as ""stylin'"" as my Australian Barmah hat (think Crocidile Dundee).

While I was looking at a similar brand in a store, a 20-something woman asked the clerk for an outdoor hat for her husband.  The clerk recommended these hats, to which she said, ""Those?  They look like Chinese rice farmer hats!""  So... I guess ""stylin'"" is a relative thing, eh?  :)","01 31, 2011",4968,213

It's well constructed and sturdy without being heavy.  The fact that it's made in the US and still comes at a good price makes it all the more appealing.

Most hankerchiefs are of whats called a standard size (12 X 12), but this product was much larger (16 X 16). The hankerchiefs hold up well when washed however they do come out wrinkled so I would suggest ironing them. Using bleach also keeps the product looking pure white & brand new. The bleach isn't harsh on the product at all. I was surprised that this item shipped fast. I ordered on one day & about four days later I received it. This item fits in all sorts of mail boxes both large & small. So don't worry if your not home when it arrives because it should fit in your mailbox. My transaction was pleasant & sweet. I had no problems with the seller at all. I received nothing, but courtesy & respect. I would most defintly buy from this seller again.

I think that the quality of the cotton cloth is fine, but the tiny hems don't have enough seam allowance to prevent the fraying.

1802,4,A1LE1OR7NGOCWV,B00080L00Q,"This product is outstanding and the price on Amazon can not be beat. Buxton owns the rights to the Dopp name and produces these ""official Dopp"" kits. The leather is good, feels solid and well stitched, but you can also get them in a slightly less expensive PVC leatherette version. You can also find these in some stores although the ones I found were double in price. Sometimes the bottoms are leather and sometimes the bottoms were a beaded plastic. Frankly I made sure to get the beaded plastic as it will last longer than a leather bottom. The key features if this Dopp kit are: 1) Construction feels solid. (Although the tag says made in China...you would feel better if it had a proud to be made in the USA tag...however, I don't think this is an issue here.) The leather and stitching feels strong. The zipper is a hefty enough piece of metal that will last. The leather handle is small enough that it fits under the fold of the kit's side if you do not want to use it. The inside is a traditional liner with a single razor pouch, however, the liner and pouch feel like they are made of a newer composite plastic material than the older plastic liners these type of kits used to have. The liner feels stronger and I doubt it will rip, which often happened with travel kits. 2) It has Dopp stamped on it, on two flaps/tabs. The tabs are aesthetic choices but look good and remind you that you have a ""real"" Dopp and not some random ""Men's Toiletry Bag.""  There are newer types of ""Dopp"" kit's out there made out of nylon mesh. If you like that I would recommend something by L.L. Bean or Swiss Army. But for something more traditional I would only recommend this brand right here...","04 12, 2010",2939,201

Pros:
- Feels and smells like genuine leather, smooth leather. (It's better to use leather care lotion once in a while as mine has started to show some creases, probably due to hot weather)
- Neat and strong stitching along the bottom, the opening, and the inner artificial fabric (see photos)
- Bottom material is made of waterproof artificial fabric, wide and hard
Cons:
- I wish the inside pouch were slightly bigger, with a zipper so stuff won't fall off, and can store more stuff
- Holds less and more expensive than my Nautica travel kit (see photos)

The sides are a nice, soft leather, the bottom a vinyl which is appropriate, given that the bag will be placed on wet countertops.  The stand-up top stays open for easy retrieval of essentials then securely snaps shut; the bag is closed by a heavy-duty zipper.  Inside the bag is a water-resistant liner with one side pocket for small items.

As for the face protector working by a touch of a button and the electronic recording, these were the selling characteristics. BUT, too pricey for not having enough positive things to balance out the negative...not enough to keep a childs interest.  My son enjoyed it the first couple of days but has not picked it up since. I also think if it fit better, (had a padded plactic skull frame inside for a snug fit) it would rate better and people wouldn't mind paying the asking price so much.","05 12, 2008",2618,79

His grandfather could also wear it with ease.  They suggest padding it with foam, so we'll try that.  But he was wearing it around and having fun opening and closing the visor at his party.

All of the kids thought it was a great finishing touch to his costume with the automatic visor and sounds.  The only down side was the weight and bulkiness of the helmet.  My son felt it was too hard to walk around in, so he carried it most of the time.

There are only two working buttons, one to open the visor and one that repeats a single message through a crackly speaker.  There is some padding on the top, but not enough.  The manufacturer acknowleges this by including a note suggesting that more padding be added.  Overall not a good value at all for the price.","10 2, 2006",13913,107

While there is no headband or suspension, the inside is padded with foam, and the whole thing is light enough that it was very comfortable.

Any helmet can get stuffy to wear, but the front visor opens up so much that it is very easy to breath, and you could wear this for hours.  The electronics are an inside speaker that repeats the same sequence, and the microphone doesn't work, but the overall look is so good that it doesn't matter.

This fits onto an adult. The talking inside the helmet is not too loud. The edge of the stickers started peeling off the outside of the helmet within the first day but could probably be fixed with a dot of super-fast drying glue.

Because it fits me, I have to dress up like an astronaut with him by putting on the helmet, but that's just a plus in my book.  The visor spring latch is a very cool function.

NASA logo has been painted on the back of the helmet (not shown in photo).  Fake buttons on front are painted (so glad their not stickers).  Thick plastic, so it should be durable.  Helmet is two pieces glued together, I hope the glue holds.  My daughter is very gentle with her stuff so it should last a long time.  For the quality, I feel I paid too much, but compared to the other options that I could find, it was worth it to pay more for this and hope we can get 3 years out of it, versus paying less and getting 3-6 months.","02 2, 2014",2135,82

2107,3,ABU9JVZPEORJQ,B0008F6WMM,"This helmet is aesthetically very cute and is made of a durable plastic. The intercom has no volume control however, the volume is not too loud for a small child. My 8 year old daughter wore this helmet for Halloween.  As many others have complained, this helmet is too oversized for smaller children; I can fit my head inside the helmet and still have some room left over, with no problem. Even my daughter, looked somewhat like a bobble-head with the huge helmet over her head! But what is worse, is the push-button visor feature; it is impractical for a helmet that is labeled ""junior"" & marketed for children, to only operate with a pushbutton feature. The push-lock feature used to close the visor, should be the same feature used to open itnot a push button. As many others have stated in the reviews, this makes the helmet more prone to malfunction or to be easily broken if mishandled or dropped. My daughter only wore this helmet  for 24 hours on Halloween; after hours of pushing & releasing the visor/button all day, I carefully put the helmet back in the box. I started to walk away & heard the visor pop-up and release on it's own, in the box. After, removing the helmet from the box, I observed the visor would no longer work it was broken. I was able to return and exchange it with Amazon, hassle free. But the point is, it should not have broken after 24hrs use; that visor button needs to be redesigned as it is flawed & impractical.","12 9, 2013",11013,734

The front is so tall, that when he flips the visor up, the remaining white part of the front covers nearly his entire bottom half of his face...poorly designed and built, and definitely NOT build with a child this age in mind.

  Disruption will only accelerate. The quantity and diversity of connected devices--many of which we haven't imagined yet--will explode, as will the quantity and diversity of the people around the world who use them.
  Our existing standards, workflows, and infrastructure won't hold up. Today's onslaught of devices is already pushing them to the breaking point. They can't withstand what's ahead.
  Proprietary solutions will dominate at first. Innovation necessarily precedes standardization. Technologists will scramble to these solutions before realizing (yet again) that a standardized platform is needed to maintain sanity.
  The standards process will be painfully slow. We will struggle with (and eventually agree upon) appropriate standards. During this period, the web will fall even further behind proprietary solutions.

On the flip side, he does love it and feels like a real astronaut while wearing it so perhaps it will get some make-believe play use. I do have a problem with the price though.

It does instruct the owner to not open the front flap manually--to only use the button located on the side.  As long as the child will remember that the helmet should last for lots of play time.

There are also sounds that play in the headset, but my kids were most thrilled with the working visor/shield.  The only drawbacks are that the helmet is generously sized...so quite big on children under 5.  Also, the box says to only open the visor with the button - but young kids instinctively want to push it up with their hands.  Although the instructions clearly say this will cause the visor to malfunction - ours hasn't broken yet (and it has been opened by hand more than once already).

We bought it for a Halloween costume (with the white astronaut suit) and the suit is really cute and realistic, but this helmet is definitely not. You can't even hear the sounds unless you are wearing the helmet, so the blastoff can only be enjoyed by the wearer. And that is the only sound, just a countdown and blastoff. No mission control stuff and anything else. Plus the flipping visor comes off a lot.

2276,1,A171GOWULTNYK2,B0009A6KFA,"When I received my ring, it was very apparent that it was made incorrectly. There was a huge gap between the diamond and the setting but only on one side. I contacted customer service to see if this could be repaired and was told that since it was a purchase over $300.00, I could only get a refund. I advised them I would be overnighting the ring back and would wait for my refund. After 7 days of waiting for my money, I received a ""repaired ring"" which ended up looking just as bad as the first one. It was the original ring that someone had poorly attempted to close the gap on the band. Not only was there still a gap, but now one side of the ring sat higher than the other. I immediately called customer service because I did not ask for another ring to be sent and explained that I had been waiting for a refund. The rep that I spoke to said he didn't see any documentation of a new ring being shipped or the old one being repaired. He told me that he would call me first thing the next morning after speaking to some of his colleagues to get this resolved. I waited 2 days and still had not heard anything so I called again. I spoke to a different rep who assured me I would have my refund the next day. I told her that I had already been waiting almost two weeks for this refund. She said she would put a rush on it but that never happened. I never did hear back from the 2 reps that I spoke with as they both promised to call me with an update. After waiting over 3 weeks I finally received my refund. My experience with Amazon was horrible. Not only was the product poorly constructed but the customer service department was no help at all. They made several promises that they did not keep and never made an attempt to keep me informed with the status of my issue. BUYERS BEWARE!!!!! Thank you for taking the time to read this...

2277,5,A2B8ZFIDSBTQVS,B0009A6KFA,"My girlfriend was to say in the least very happy and excited to get the ring. Quite a few people were skeptical that I bought my ring from Amazon, but after a jeweler's appraisal all skepticism was satisfied. Jeweler appraised about 40% higher than what I paid.","05 16, 2007",16701,147
2278,5,A3EU4PJK9MKS81,B0009A6KFA,"Dealing with jewlery salespeople is like dealing with car dealers.... misearble.  Using Amazon to buy the engagement ring was the best decision I could have made.  Such an easy process, such a great price, and the customer service was superb.  There was a slight delay in delivery (one day) and I had an email letting me know to expect the delay, and a refund of $70 for the inconvience.  The ring showed up looking exactly like I thought it would, my fiance loved it, as has everyone she has shown.  I would recommend getting your ring on Amazon to anyone I know.","02 25, 2006",1256,697
2279,3,A2QQRX2C0NSV3W,B0009A6KFA,"I whish Amazon would pay more attention to details, when a customer pays $6K for a product. Remember that when I go to buy a ring in a store, the level of service is quite different compare to Blockbuster. You offer far more info on DVDs, then on a ring. I do expect actual digital pictures of the ring to be sent before the actual shipment in very high resolution.

The bad and very bad:

1. The proportions of the diamond to ring are not even close to the diagram.

2. 18K white gold is not even close to white, and you better have it in bold! Usually, rings like this are covered with Palladium, but not here.

3. Packaging is rather cheap. Would be OK for a $300 ring, but not for $6K

4. It was 2 days late. Once again, it would be OK with a DVD...

5. Engraving on the ring says ""Amazon"" in bold. It's not what I expected. So, have it in bold as well!

6. I do expect, at least, direct e-mail/chat support before and after the large purchase like this. Not just return policy.

7. Back to pictures. Usually, when you buy the stone in a store, you have an opportunity to look at the diamond with 10x magnification. So, I expect the picture like this when I select the diamond.

The good:

1. Having the scan of the diamond certificate is great.

2. Automated diamond search system is very good.

3. Looks like the craftsmanship is good.","09 20, 2005",12128,231

It's great shoe just disappointed we can't let her wear them and on top of that I know that Minnetonka doesn't use good lasting material for these shoes that make (I've been wearing Minnetonka forever and my shoes either always have a whole in them by year 2 or the soles wear out by year 3).

If you click on the size chart you will see where it indicates the appropriate size for the length of your child's foot.  My son's foot is 3"" to 3.5"" inches long so I ordered size 1.

The back of the shoe does not have a support ""rod"" so it slouches and easily comes off their foot. If your little one is like mine they can easily untie these which then even makes it worse for them coming off. I think the ones that have the three tier of fringe and zip up may be better than the tie bootie. They are very very cute though.

They're well made but the tie laces are not the best and you'll need to double knot and most likely adjust because they will untie.

They are quite comfortable, but do require some breaking-in. I wore them around the house for about a week before wearing them outside. They ARE stiff, but it is important to remember that wingtips are SUPPOSED to be stiff. The toe-cap and wings (longwings on these shoes) are there to make the shoe sturdier than standard oxfords. The stiffness will ease over time. These are clearly shoes that are meant to last. The leather sole gives excellent support, and the slightly padded insole makes these very comfortable walking shoes. The burgundy colour (""oxblood"") is beautiful, and the leather has a very nice finish. They run a bit small. I usually wear 8.5, though sometimes 9 with thicker walking socks.

The 11 wides are perfect, and don't have that wide appearance like other brands. I am on my third pair of blacks. I did not like the burgundy color, as they are too dark from my brown suits, to dressy for khakis, and I already have my blacks for dark suits, so they are basically worthless unless I wanted to wear them with a burgundy belt and blue suits.

Past Bostonians I have bought (including my previous pair of Bostonians)were made in Mexico and fit and felt much better.  I guess Bostonian shoes just what they use to be.

2496,1,A1BHSYKSO2JGRL,B000AL4RXA,"Let me qualify this review a little, growing up my parents couldn't afford to buy me the fancy big box of crayons, you know the one with the built in sharpener and 128 colors? I was quite content with the 8 crayon package, but what happened as A result is that my ability to name colors is impaired. I can see, differentiate and appreciate color just fine, but I only know a handful of color names. Well, burgundy wasn't in my package of crayons so maybe he name of that color of the shoes I received was burgundy, BUT they were nowhere near the color depicted on the web site.

Now before any aspiring technologist points out my monitor may not be calibrated etc., these were not even close. These shoes were a pinkish purple, and had zero, none, not a hint of depth to the color. It looked like these were spray painted. I was replacing a worn out pair and I had to double take on these. I even went back on line to see if I chose a different color accidentally. These were terrible. The leather was very stiff and the fit ran small.

The photo shows a classically styled long wing tip shoe in a classic deep hue, these shoes were like a bad knock-off of what is shown!","03 3, 2015",2470,409

My only complaint is that they are taking a while to break in. I wear these at least every other business day and the sides are still stiff, causing discomfort for my ankles. Then again, I am not surprised: I have another pair of Bostonians with which I have had a similar experience. These are durable shoes, so I'd say they are worth the wait -- and the occasional discomfort -- that comes with breaking them in.","02 22, 2015",6672,89

This is my third pair of Bostonians. I have some captoes and some loafers of theirs and I wear them both all the time. I bought these wingtips in my usual size 12, and they are like a hundred-dollar torture device. It feels like someone's standing on my big toes while slicing off my ankles with a rusty knife. I can't decide whether to exchange them for a 13, or just go with a different shoe altogether. I was disappointed because I really wanted to love this shoe, and it ordered them for a special occasion.

I must note that the shoe did not feel tight in any way, but the stiffness and molding of the leather just tore me up.  BTW - I requested an exchange, which Amazon handled promptly, but the replacement pair were exactly the same.  As such, after one wearing (and experiencing incredible pain) I was forced to request an exchange again, but this time I chose a Florsheim model and I am now very happy.

Mine began to have a very noticeable crease on the top middle area after a few weeks of wear. This is even when using shoe trees after every wear and polishing once a week. It is much more pronounced in one shoe than the other. I'm not particularly knowledgeable of what having very flat feet can do to the contours of a shoe, but I wouldn't be surprised if my feet exacerbated the process.

I ordered the orange and black ones, they came in one size but I was not expecting that one size to fit a prepubecent child.  I couldn't even pull these up past my hips.  They were either made for a 10 year old or an abnormally tiny woman.  Now it's about 6 days until halloween and I gotta run out to spirit store and buy a decent pair from there.  Just a huge waste of time and energy.  Had I known I would have waited nearly a month for them only for them to not fit, I would have just gone out and bought some.  Thanks amazon seller guy.

Sterling silver is 7.5 percent copper which can turn green, and some people seem to have body chemistry that's prone to staining.

It is a very elegant looking, dainty ring. The stone is a little loose but that is to be expected with the type of setting and the overall look you want from this ring. I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.","08 19, 2008",2039,484

2817,2,AWBGHDHH7E51F,B000BD7SGK,"I had a little shipping problem(no fault of the seller) and waited a long time for this ring.  I was disappointed when I opened the box. It looks cheap to me.  The setting for the stone is cheapo...not the band, but the metal the stone is actually set in. I've had it 2 years and have only worn it twice. It may work for a teenager. The band itself is nice and the stone size is small, just the way I wanted it. It has never tarnished. I know it was inexpensive, but it looks that way too....at least to me.  Gem Avenue does sell some of the best snake chains I have ever seen in sterling.  They are very durable and require little cleaning and they do not tarnish...period.  I had mine for 2 years  and wear them often.  They are inexpensive, but very well made and good looking.","03 25, 2008",5345,13
2818,1,A10ZLDE6EA1TYV,B000BD7SGK,"I liked it, until the stone fell out. If you look at how the ring is constructed, the stone is just sitting between the two metal arms. That mean if one gets twisted or pulled, out goes the stone.

It wasn't worth the money to send it back.

The thin band is very comfortable, and the cubic zirconia is exactly the right size and shape for this setting.  I think this is a ring that any girl would love.  It works well as a promise ring, a ""thinking about you a lot"" ring, or just an ""I still like you"" ring.  The price is low, but with a ring this pretty, it really doesn't matter.","12 30, 2007",4030,302

The zipper starts at the bottom so there was no way to get any additional slack. I got the chaps a day before leaving on an extended vacation and didn't try them on until returning home.

When you pop out to set the time, the minute hand flops around a teenie bit so when you set the time you have to be careful how you click the set knob back in or it can move the minute hand a little. Not very accurate and really annoying to me.

However, yes, it's fine for the price I guess but I'm now looking for another pocket watch. It's not worth it for me to send it back so I'm donating it to a thrift store and spending more money this time for something with a bit more quality.","06 24, 2008",10803,187

The inside of the cover is like brushed steel, with circle patterns and the face looked nice and simple, with a second hand. The numbers were easy to read and included military time in smaller red font beneath it, as well as minute conversion in small black just above them. It made it easy to tell the time at a glance.

2890,5,A339ZUO82VKCTA,B000E3AUIA,"The bag is comfortable to wear, watertight, and has bunch of compartments to hold your stuff. I especially like the two front side zippered pockets, very convenient. The main compartment has a pocket that will fit a 13"" computer, though it can accommodate a larger one simply by putting it in the main compartment (duh). Jansport bags are usually very good, and this one is not exception.","10 30, 2008",5439,656
2891,5,A1K5G6X7L15MOC,B000E3AUIA,"This bag is very spacious and holds a lot of stuff, enough that I can even use it as a weekender bag when I'm not using it as a daily book bag.  For anyone who, like I did before buying this bag, wonders whether it's suitable for laptop storage, the main compartment has what the manufacturer describes simply as a ""divider,"" but which is padded on all sides, so it makes for a serviceable laptop sleeve.  The bag has an ample number of intelligently-designed pockets for keeping organized everything from little stuff like pens and post-it notes and such, to mid-sized pockets suitable for holding items about the size of a paperback.  It has an elasticized mesh side pocket that offers quick and easy (i.e., unzippered) access to stuff like a water bottle, a small umbrella, mp3 player, cell phone, keys, etc..  The ballistic nylon is seemingly indestructible - it has successfully resisted a number of attacks from my springer spaniel - and sheds rain easily.  All in all, a very versatile, dependable, and well-thought out bag.","10 12, 2008",9336,147
2892,4,A1GMV9DUWFDEQF,B000E3AUIA,"I had an older messenger bag from Jansport that i unfortunaltey lost along the way. This seemed to be a suitable replacement. It is a little large for my tastes. I guess they make adequate space for a laptop, but I don't need it for that, for the most part. Pockets are certainly big, the grab handge is a little narrow, and thin. A little more color would be nice, because it is all black, with the exception of the logo being outlined in red. other than those minor complaints, i do like it.","02 24, 2008",948,20
2893,3,A2Y59GIYS4BFU6,B000E3AUIA,"This is a roomy, well-made and sturdy bag - my big gripe with it is that there is no handle, just the shoulder strap.  For some reason, there is a thin, flimsy strap at the top which looks like it could be used to hang the empty bag on a coat hook.  I don't see the point.  I like this bag, but assumed it would have a standard handle like all of the other messenger-type bags I've owned.  Makes it diffifult to carry at times.","02 18, 2008",7451,124
2894,4,A2W2FRLTIEU0MG,B000E3AUIA,"I bought this bag for the Jansport name, which, as a student and a teacher, I trust.  I intend to use this bag for a trip across Europe, then to use it as a laptop bag.

Good points:
-the Jansport name and guarantee.
-Water bottle holder on one side of the bag (great for me in Europe, and a key factor for me buying this bag)
-decent, if not great, laptop protection
-good size--can hold a lot of stuff or a little bit of stuff without losing shape or look
-comfortable to wear on shoulder or across body
-good length of strap (and it's adjustable)

Bad points:
-the flap is held down by two small, unadjustable latches.  I've found them difficult to use one-handed, and they just seem flimsy.  I'd much rather have one heavy-duty latch.
-The shoulder padding is a bit awkward...but it can be removed, and I think it will improve as I break the bag in.
-The smaller pockets in the front are not that great in design.  If you lift the flap, there are three pockets in the front of the bag.  (There's also a large zip pocket in the flap, which is good for easy access.)  Anyway, the center pocket is OK...nothing too fancy, but a zip front and requisite card holders, key holder, etc.  Above this, there are two narrow pockets that are a few inches wide and go down the whole front of the bag (thing a tall, thin rectangle behind the main front pocket on either side).  These pockets are pretty much useless to me...they're too thin for much stuff, and they're awkward to get to for easy access.
-The material seems thin.  However, since this is a Jansport bag, I'm trusting it will hold up.","02 9, 2008",9806,664

I keep my 14.1"" laptop, usb mouse, battery charger, palm pilot, palm pilot keyboard and random paperwork in this bag, and it is NOT overstuffed!  Everything important for my daily travels fits in this bag, and still looks stylish with the slim fit pockets!

There is a wide foam pad that I lay my laptop against, and I have nothing to worry about as I carry it along while shooting pictures.

The construction is the best, but then again, it is a Jansport, so you should already know that you have nothing to worry about in that department.

I would highly recommend this bag for laptop and business paperwork carrying.","10 18, 2007",8762,727

She initially rated it five stars  but decided on four because the pad on the shoulder strap is always moving out of place, causing the strap to hurt her shoulder when full.  Other than that, she loves that it is very roomy.  She especially appreciates the two side pockets that can fit her PE clothes. The water bottle holder is very handy.

I recently took it to a study group with my lap top in a case, 2"" binder, 3 workbooks, a note book and my planner and everything fit just fine (along with quite a bit of things in the front pockets.

I had stupidly assumed that because my laptop is a fairly standard size and the bag got so many reviews about it's large size, my laptop would fit.

2970,5,A3R7F1FUPO8CLA,B000E3AUIA,"PROS:
1. Many compartments inside and outside bag
2. Can be used for many purposes, as the material is very durable.
3. Minor wear-and-tear after three years of ownership
4. the shoulder pad is adjustable for all ages and sizes

CONS:
1. They should make more of these items for children, such as Walt Disney, as once this product is in the family, everyone is going to want one

RECOMMENDATION:
I recommend this product for anyone looking for a backpack, travel bag or utility bag. I use this bag for college, for work and when we go camping. It has really took it's fair share in beating and still stands it's ground. The material has not ripped in three years, and barely has minor wear and tear. This product by far receives a 5-Star rating. And for the price, its very affordable.","04 8, 2013",18155,252

I need to be able to carry both for the program I am in and work.  In addition to a laptop and iPad, I need room for books and this bag is suitable for how many I carry.  The side pockets work great for cords!

I have a Gateway laptop that measures 15.02L by 9.96W according to the product info... It fits in the bag, just not in the laptop compartment...

2991,5,A1DRL4CC8P3T8I,B000E3AUIA,"I purchased this Jansport messenger bag after years of using the standard strap backpack. Considering the amount of wear and tear that I gave the said backpack, it was in considerably good condition. Thus, when I decided to search for its replacement, I looked among the Jansport brand. When I saw this messenger bag's style, I was instantly attracted to it. After receiving it, I was pleased with its appearance and its functional pockets and compartments. The only downside to it is that the strap isn't well cushioned, making it a bit uncomfortable when carrying anything over 5 pounds. Overall, this messenger bag/tote is a great value for those interested in upgrading from a standard backpack.","07 15, 2012",306,863
2992,4,A2O4BRCQ3CM9UI,B000E3AUIA,"I've been using this bag for a couple of years now and as others have stated this is a pretty large bag which can be a pro or con. It has a sporty look and now I use it more as an overnight/gym bag than an office bag, but it served me well carrying around books and folders for years. While the storage space was nice, some parts of the bag haven't held up well. Within the first year the water bottle holder made of mesh broke. Also it doesn't have a true handle, rather a small strip attached to the back which you can use if you need to grab the bag quickly. This broke and it gets annoying when I just want to pick up and carry the bag briefly. Lastly this bag doesn't have much padding for laptops, and while it does have a compartment, I would recommend getting an additional sleeve.

Pros:
-Lots of space
-Versatile
-Durable main compartments

Cons:
-Might be too large for some people
-Water bottle holder broke
-Laptop compartment not very padded

Overall it's a good versatile bag, just be sure you're okay with the size.","07 8, 2012",19403,567

I purchased another one for my boyfriend recently (Fall 2008) b/c he was so in love with my bag. The design in generally the same, but the quality of the material has seriously deteriorated. You can tell the fabric is made of much cheaper stuff. The front zip pocket use to have a compartment to slide things into, but it now just sown directly onto the bag (eliminating a good partition in front pocket). There is also this tiny piece of fabric sown on as a 'handle' to use to carry it, but it's so feeble, it's not really much of an improvement.

If you didn't know what the old one was like, I'd still say it was a pretty good bag...nice colors options now too, but clearly cutting back on the quality of the materials and workmanship.","02 26, 2009",459,825

It has a number of pockets, a key ring, among other areas to keep yourself organized, this zippered area provides a secure place to carry a  wallet or music player without having the worry of being pick-pocketed. We live in Chicago and this is a wonderful commuter bag as well. The strap has an adjustable pad for heavier loads as well as a padded back for wearing while biking. There is also a netted external pouch for bottles. The main compartment of the bag is secured by a long zipper that runs the length of the opening and also has a padded divider for occasionally transporting any size laptop.

I wear this set everyday and it fits great and is a good quality metal. I have not had any issues with the rings turning my fingers green like I did with a cheaper set I bought locally before I found this. I also received the product very quickly.

3032,1,A1N87IY8T3VMYS,B000E9LSSK,"!!!!BUYER BEWARE!!!!!
When I received this set, to say that I was disappointed, would be a gross understatement.  I was disgusted!  First of all, the ring was damaged/defective (whatever you want to call a mess up).  The center stone was improperly set and positioned within he prongs.  It was crooked.  And I assure you it was extremely obvious.  It didn't take any close inspection to see.  It was glaring.  Then the prongs themselves were also bent down in mismatched places on the stone, one being bent straight down the side edge of the stone vs. pointing relatively toward the center.  This only added to the overall impression of the stone being crooked.  It made the stone look as if IT were misshapen and cut wrong.

I get that you can't expect fake jewelry that costs $30 to be the same quality as the real deal... But this?  It looks like it came off the $5 carousel at walmart.  And frankly, I wouldn't have bought it from there, for that price.  It looks like crap.  It looks like a gumball machine ring, or something that could have come out of a little girl's dress up set.

Now, even had the prongs been set properly, etc. I still wouldn't have worn it.  That just added insult to injury.  The ring, had it been in perfect shape, still would have looked like something from the dollar store.  It doesn't look anymore ""real"" than a peice of glass stuck in a plastic band.  The silver even looks funny. It looks like tin foil. The reflective sheen is a dead give away.

The stones don't look like diamonds at all.  They don't even look like good immitations.  They look like cheap junk.

Also the center stone is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to large to be believable. On anybody.  It's about a 3-4 ct. stone.  It looks absurdly fake.  So unless you think that your friends might actually be able to bring themselves to believe that you could afford a $15,000.00 ring, then ummm yeah it'll be too big.

And if you can pull that off, then maybe you can also convince them that you know, all good metals are as shiny as tin foil, too.

Don't get this ring.  Don't waste your money.

BTW.. I found a beautiful, well crafted and believable ring for a little bit more $$$ (but still at a VERY decent price) at [...]","06 1, 2010",977,743

The center stone is a tiny bit crooked, but no one will really notice unless they are seriously studying it or if I point it out. Other than that the rings are gorgeous. Much nicer than I expected them to be. I have gotten so many compliments and a friend of mine didn't believe that they weren't real. The sizing was right on.

I absolutely love the setting, and the cut of the CZ. To me, it doesn't scream fake, but if you get close to it and really want to analyze it, you will probably be able to tell its a CZ, although I think it sparkles and shines just as well or better than some diamonds personally. The only thing that I think could be a little better is that it could be a little more scratch resistant, but that could be the plating as I have had other sterling silver rings that weren't plated that didn't scratch as easily.

3043,5,A1ZFFD68S6UE31,B000E9LSSK,"After looking at rings for a wedding set for about 4 months I finally decided to purchase this set. I received them and they are perfect. Since they were such a cheap price I didn't expect them to be this nice. I wanted somethng that I could wear without having to worry about freaking out if I lost a stone out of one or banging them around when working. I am very picky, my husband says I have a little bit of OCD. I was concerened that the center stone would be to big and look fake or that the other stones would be so small you wouldn't be able to see them at all. I also was worrying about other issues that I had read about on reviews of other rings. The Size, the center stone being lose right out of the package, the stones turning black or quickly falling out. I had also read the review on this ring that said that there was a little gap between the rings because the center stone on the engagement ring was not set up high enough to let the rings nest together. So I was very anxious to actually receive the set in the mail and try them out for myself. They finally got here and I was VERY surprised to say the least. They were perfect. The stones were just the right size, not to small but not big enough they looked fake when showing people. The women at my work thought that they were real. All of the stones were secure in their settings and they are still just as sparkly now as when I took them out of the box. I wear a size 10 ring and its hard for me to find nice rings in my size. When I Took these out of the box and put them on they fit perfectly. There is a TINY gap between the rings but it is VERY TINY (so tiny I can't even think of anything that would fit in the gap between them, maybe you could get a VERY tiny knife blade between them but that s about it.) and not noticeable to anyone other than the wearer. I am VERY pleased with this purchase and I will be ordering from this seller again!","06 7, 2009",18317,917

I wish the setting for the stone sat up a little higher, but it's still pretty on my finger.  My husband loves it!

It was lighter than air, and felt like it was made out of plastic. I wore it for the day, took it off that night, and realized that it was scratched where the stone on the engagement ring meets the wedding band.

I am sadly disappointed in this purchase. It was cheap, and now I know why. I was unsure of whether or not I actually wanted a fancy diamond wedding set, and this answered my question, at a very inexpensive price. I now know that the traditional wedding set is not for me. I'm glad I purchased this ring first before I purchased something far more expensive.

At a glance the ring is beautiful. If you don't mind feeling like you are wearing a plastic ring, then go for it. I for one need something a little more substantial and will be purchasing a Robert Lee Morris ring for my wedding ring.","09 24, 2008",17577,928

The only reason I rated it a 4 instead of 5 was because the center stone should be set up higher to allow the two rings to nest.  Due to how the prong is set, there is a small gap between the rings when they are placed next to each other (again, something no one else but the wearer will notice).","03 28, 2008",1164,77

But the dress arrived and was made of such an awful material and so unflattering that I ordered another - paying MORE in shipping than the cost of the new outfit.

The red top was made of some sort strange puffy rubberized felt that buckled and created a lumpy look.  The skirt was a billowing sticky plastic.  The leggings that create the thigh-high boot effect have no way of staying up on your thigh, no elastic or anything, so they just slide down your leg.  And the cape's Velcro around your neck is extremely tight without any room to loosen it.  I ordered a medium and I'm a thin person but it was sewn to fit a kid.

Look, it's alot of work and material for a very low cost and I could understand cheap workarounds to keep the price low but it's super unflattering and unworkable.","01 22, 2017",11569,894

The waist and skirt fit fine, but I was not able to fill the top too well. The back of the top has plenty of extra fabric (I didn't need it) but the elastic worked well to hold the top up. I wore a bra with clear straps and the top stayed on just fine. You can see in the picture that the top sagged a bit. That part of the costume (the top) is lined with a thin layer of foam. If purchased in advance, it can be altered to fit better. The boot covers did the job. I held them down over my shoes by using clear bandage tape. The cape is adorable, but I must have a big neck because it was a bit tight. Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase. I got lots of compliments on the costume.","11 1, 2016",14716,823

3284,5,A9QN5GI63UNEC,B000EE1NNA,I bought this to wear as a Halloween costume for a party. It fit great but I didn't love the boot covers so I ended up just buying a pair from Goodwill and spray painting them. Other than that it looked amazing,"10 31, 2016",11929,411
3285,2,A1ICHUAU466UKI,B000EE1NNA,"The costume is ok at best. The top was fine although shorter than I hoped for (I'm 5'10 with even proportions), but the skirt is awful. The sewing was done haphazardly and there were several places with the skirt bunched up in the seam and the fabric looked terrible. The pleats at the center were completely off center too. I took the skirt off and reattached it so it laid smoothly and was even. The skirt had several places where the blue was coming off because the material is cheap. If it got snagged on something or was pulled at all it would turn white and look awful.
Order down a size or two. If you're on the larger end of what each size will fit, order down 1 size. If you're on the smaller end of each size, go 2 sizes smaller.
I'd prefer straps on it even if they're clear or any way to keep the top up better. Because it fits such a large range there is a TON of elastic on the back and if you're not pulling it tight it doesn't stay up and had an unflattering fit.
The boot covers are poorly made too. I have big calves and they were too big on me. They won't stay up and there's no real way for the cover to stay in place. There's only an elastic that's supposed to go under your shoe but that doesn't work because It attaches with Velcro on the bottom of the shoe so you're stepping on it the whole time. The only way to keep this in place would be to spray glue it to whatever shoes your wearing. You're better off buying the actual boots which look awesome. Too bad I saw them too late to get here in time.
 I wouldn't buy this again unless I was desperate.","10 31, 2016",8726,411

Many of the reviews on here suggested going a size down because it apparently runs small. This was not the case for me. A size down made it near impossible to get on. And unfortunately there ware no fasteners or zippers in the back, which would have been extremely helpful.

The material on the bust is awful. Super scratchy/itchy material. Very hot and uncomfortable. The skirt bunches at the top, so it's kind of a mushroom shape down there. Not flattering at all. When I opened my package all the material was slightly melted together as well. Pulling the pieces apart from one another resulted in discoloration.

Very unhappy with this purchase. I'm pretty sure it's not returnable now either because I already unpackaged everything in order to try it on.","10 31, 2016",3018,356

The skirt is made of some shiny material that sticks to itself and when you manage to peel the skirt apart, the color comes off of it and looks terrible. The tissue paper somehow managed to stick to the tiara and can't be peeled off of the star. The cape stuck to the skirt too and when I peeled the cape off, the color came off the skirt AND the cape.

The bodice is pull on (or pull it all over your head), rouched in the back with elastic around the top, in the back only. The bust is too large for a C cup. It is made of a very thick material, so if you slouch a little, the material bulges out and it looks like I have big rolls.

I wish there was a good way to make it a bit shorter so that it doesn't bunch up and create the illusion of tummy rolls, which I have recently worked pretty hard to eliminate!  Overall, I have made the fit quite good, but I did remove a piece of elastic from the inside of the back of the skirt that was about 6 "" long so it pulled the skirt to the point of being so tight it hurt.  Removal of that piece and the skirt hangs very nicely and the torso fit pretty well.  The top part is definitely designed for a well-endowed person, so I had to take in a few inches there as well.  The belt was a bit tight, so I moved the Velcro over to make it fit.  The cape Velcro was positioned weird so that it scratched my neck when attached, so I moved  one piece 90 degrees to the other so that the neck attachment actually forms a ""V"" point, which I believe is how it is supposed to look.  I am currently shopping for some boots to wear because the boot covers are a bit of a joke compared to the rest of the costume, which is pretty decent quality.  Overall I do like the costume, but I would say that chances are quite slim it will fit anyone perfectly right out of the package.
My top is the fuzzy covered foam material, and the skirt is a shiny polyester.  I did buy some biking-type shorts to wear underneath for comfort, with the blue and white star pattern than matches almost perfectly.  The skirt is a good length, but still a bit short for a 50 year old woman going out in public.","10 3, 2016",6672,89

One flaw is the boot covers do not stay up at all!  I had to put rubber bands on each boot at the top by my knees, to hold the boot covers up.  Then the toe part keeps sliding off my shoes.  So I bought the actual wonder woman boots to wear instead. (not pictured) Other than the boot covers being horrible, the costume is very comfortable and cute!  I can't wait till Halloween to wear it!  The picture is with everything that comes with the costume, the boot covers look cute but do not stay up, it wasn't too bad with the rubber bands at the top but then the foot part would slide off as I walked around.

3366,3,A1I3UMCCILYW9L,B000EE1NNA,"To consider the number of stars I would give this, I had to take into consideration the various components of this costume.  I am 5'6"" and 135 pounds and ordered the small costume, and it fits nicely.  Here is my review:

The bodice/skirt: the main piece of the costume consists of the bodice (top) and skirt, which are connected.  Overall, this part of the costume is pretty decently constructed, and I would give it 4 out of 5 stars.  The bodice is a velvety material and has some stretch and structure to it, but I noticed other reviews mention a zipper.  Mine did not have a zipper, so I had to pull it over my head and hope not to stretch it too much.  It fits pretty snugly, but does not provide chest support, so it would most likely have to be worn with a strapless bra or bustier for a little more structure.  I am a 34D and the small provided enough coverage.  The skirt is cute, a shiny blue material with gold stars, not much else to say about that.

The knee-high boot covers: terrible and unusable!  The tops are not tight enough and sag, and the bottoms hang loosely and won't completely cover boots.  I won't wear them with this costume, and I might try to find an alternative.

The belt: fits nicely around my waist/hips, although just barely.  I could see if someone was more curvy, the belt might not fit. The belt would be better with a little stretch to it or some elastic in the back.

Arm cuffs: while the rest of the costume has gold accessories, the cuffs are silver.  They are very basic and loose on my forearms.  I will wear them, just so I have something on my wrists, but I might spray paint them gold.

Head piece: will work just fine!  It is as pictured and wraps around the head and fastens with Velcro.

Cape: lightweight and fastens around the neck.  The Velcro fasteners are a little scratchy on my neck, but it's a costume, so I expect a little Velcro here and there.  Thankfully, the cape helps to hide some of the imperfections of the bodice.

I should mention that I had to exchange my costume for another in the same size because the bodice of the costume had some weird bulging on the sides that made it look like I have rolls under my arms and on my sides.  I haven't received the replacement, so I hope it will be sewn a little more carefully.","07 27, 2016",4372,248

You will definitely need a push up bra or something because it's not real piping and is a velour cover more than a bodice. The skirt is short as expected and I will be wearing some type of boy short or something underneath. The belt does not fit at all! It fits my head and is essentially the same length as the head band! The silver arm bands are fairly cheesy. Almost look like they belong to an astronaut costume. I think I may try to make my own if I have time. The boot covers aren't great. They are really long but could be tucked in. The material is transparent but on top of boots, that wouldn't matter. I don't think they will stay on though as there is no elastic in the toe to keep them in place. There is a strap that goes underneath, but it was still loose for me. I think I'll end up spray painting a pair of boots I use for costumes anyway. The cape is made of polyurethane foam, it seems like it all is, but will work fine. I ordered this for my sons 6th birthday as he wanted a Halloween birthday party. All in all I think it's cute & will work for what I need with some minor modifications.","07 7, 2016",2135,82

There is elastic around the back of the bodice, but the entire back panel sags, making the skirt fall uneven. The neck opening of the cape is very small too, and the velcro fastener closes too snugly. There are large tags and strings everywhere that need to be snipped. The arm cuffs are also super wide. I'm going to try and have a seamstress sew up the sides a little and try to make it fit instead of attempting to return this. I'm really disappointed with the quality, workmanship and value for the price. It's not worth it.

Also, I definitely did not have enough cleavage to fill in the bust area!  Although I did not find the costume very flattering on my body type (it would probably look much better on someone with more of an hour-glass figure), I still got a lot of compliments on Halloween.

The second you bend over or sit down, the material instantly and permanently creases where it was folded, making the bodice look chunky and bizarre. The bodice also accentuates any extra ""cushion"" you might have on your midsection.... Really truly horrible. Unless you have a super toned abdomen with no excess chunk, and unless you're POSITIVE you won't sit down or bend down even ONCE all night, then you might be okay with this costume.

- There's a hole in the top

- Material is stretchy spandex and not velvety with bones like what's been described in other people's posts. You can see every bump...

I am 5'9"" and weigh 143, I have a 34"" in seam and am average bust size. The dress is a velvet type material (no wire in the bodice area though) and the skirt portion is a satiny type material. The skirt was a good length (still sexy), even though most of the time being so tall skirts are too short. The head band was a bit big and the silver arm cuffs didn't fit quite right. The boot covers were fine, where as the reviews I read said that they were really loose. Order this according to your actual size! I would say that this costume would fit a girl perfectly that is very busty, very small waisted and not too tall ( maybe 36- 24-34 measurements).

1. It was NOT the same costume, the materials are not the same, the quality was poor. I went to a costume store and found the exact one pictured here, the materials were completely different from the one I received in the mail.
2. The sizing was WAY off. I am a 10/12, and according to this sizing chart, the large should have fit without issue. This costume was so small, I thought they had actually sent me the wrong size.

The library couldn't find a Wonder Woman costume for me so I bought this one myself, and I fit in fine with the rented costumes other people wore.  It was nice because it was modest for the kids at the bust and skirt (the woman's chest in this picture isn't how you'll look unless you're using some major duct tape).  I ordered smaller because the reviews recommended it - I'm a 36DD, 32"" waist, 40"" hips, and always a ""large"" - but the medium fit perfectly.  As others said, the ""boots"" are pretty worthless, but I knew that going in so I was prepared with other boots.  The quality is good enough for parties and such, and the price was great.","07 17, 2015",1340,376
3519,5,A3SYYPTB07P8O7,B000EE1NNA,"Loved being wonder women for Halloween. I work at a elementary school so super hero costumes can be used often. ESP the cape. The whole costume was of good quality and the cape didn't hurt your neck as it velcroed behind your neck and had padding in the front. The leg pieces would sometimes fall down but I just pinned them to socks I was wearing underneath.
Overall I loved it and would consider buying another costume from this seller.","07 7, 2015",13695,409

I have large hips so the skirt was a little less than flattering with all of the pleats, but overall, it was good.  The belt that comes with it is really big, especially if you have a little waist.  The boot cover things don't stay up unless you have something to attach them to but they look alright.  The cape and the other accessories are a little cheesy but it is what is expected for what you pay.  The top part of the costume is a foamy kind of material that does stay up well.  It can bunch up along the sides though.  If you have a larger chest, I'd recommend a strapless bra to go with it.","06 8, 2015",2885,180
3524,4,AT6T6R96E7Y7V,B000EE1NNA,"Super fun. Got lots of compliments. Very bright! Definitely runs large. I'd normally get an XL in off-the-rack costumes, but after reading the reviews, I got a large, and even that was a bit roomy. But I worked with it because a medium would probably have been too small. Wore a boned corset underneath. Necessary, as the bodice has no real structure--just an elasticized pull up. But I was going to wear the corset anyway, so that worked fine for me. Cape is a bit tight around the neck, as some have said, but wore it all night and it was okay. Boot covers were loose and didn't stay up very well, but made it work with some wardrobe tape. Only thing that didn't work at all were the armbands...they are HUGE! Ha ha so ridiculously large. So I just did without them. But overall it was a big success. Bright and fun and lots of impact! The hit of the evening.","05 25, 2015",13201,642

The body part looks the same but the belt is a different material, same material as the arm bands, sorry I don't know what to call it. I didn't wear the arm bands because I had my own better ones. Head band is a good one, looks good with the outfit. Clearly the description says you get boot covers, not the boots in the picture, but they resemble the boots. I wore them over jeans and had to pin them, but they looked good enough for me. The cape part around your neck is different from the picture and was tight on my neck, kind of irritating, but it looks good with the cape. The top red part with the ww  was really bunched up on the sides. I couldn't pin it to fix it or anything. I wore a sweater over it because I wore it to school so it looked ok, but I wouldn't wear it out with just the cape. Maybe mine was sewn funny. Skirt was nice looking, shiny. Everybody liked the costume and I would buy it again because it was the only wonder woman costume that was appropriate (with pants underneath) for school.

I did however buy some leggings with stars and a red shirt and designed it for myself. I did use the accessories with it and ordered a lasso from Etsy. I love the boots and accessories.

Get this 2 sizes smaller if you want a perfect fit.","11 3, 2014",8550,467
3583,3,AXX494OBMNC2C,B000EE1NNA,"I took note of the reviews when I ordered this and got a medium instead of a large. I am either a 10 or a 12 in most items, so I was torn as to what size to order. I have a slim waist but I 'm curvy and I also didn't want it to be too short, so I got a medium thinking that would be the right size, since it would be a ""Big Medium,"" which is the size I would normally wear anyway.

I should have gotten a small.

The bottom half of the dress fit fine, but the top was baggy.  I wear a DD cup so this is not usually I problem I encounter, but the issue lay in the fabric the top is made out of. It's velveteen on the outside but the lining is this awful foamy stuff, presumably used to give the top more structure.  The top fit okay through the chest, only a little loose, but because it was cut funny it was very bunchy through the waist and the foam lining only made this bunching more noticeable. I could grab an handful of the elasticized portion in the back, it was very loose.  If they had nixed the foam lining I could have altered this to skim over my curves better but alas, the stiffness of the lining made it too hard to pin attractively.

It made me look like I had rolls because of the way it bunched at the waist.  Definitely buy the smallest size you think you can get away with to avoid all the extra fabric.

Otherwise a good costume.  I didn't wear the bootcovers because I wore red tights instead but everything else was at least okay. I liked the shine of the skirt.","11 3, 2014",7111,646

The material is elastic and feels a little flimsy, but for a couple of wears, it'll do fine.  Top feels velvety, skirt plastic.  Beautiful, lively colors; ordered Prime and got it in four days.  Skirt was decent length for such a tall girl, but since the material from this part is so flimsy, she'll probably wear it with some kind of short-shorts in case it rips of the wind gets a hold of it.

I talked her into this costume and it looks great on her!  As she is larger chested, it doesn't want to stay up, being that it is strapless.  She added nude colored straps which help hold it up, and isn't noticeable.  Also, the gauntlets are large, so fitted them with some velcro to sinch tighter.  The boot covers don't want to stay up, so added a small string of elastic around the top to keep them up over regular boots.  The cape neck is way to tight.  The costume runs a little short, so jazz pants or shorts are recommended.  All in all, a really cute costume for the buck!!!  : )","10 29, 2014",388,990

Everything about the costume is what I expected it to be and more besides the size. A lot of reviews were complaining of it being too big but I suppose it depends on how you are wanting it to fit.

The overall appearance of the dress is nice and hope after fitting it sewing somehow it will be okay, however, the boot covers, belt and head band are ridiculously cheap looking and huge as well.

The skirt has a lot of gathers, making my bottom half appear larger than it is, but the belt fits snugly with the Velcro matching up.  The boot covers are a tad snug on my calves so they will stay up.  The headband fits and is nicely subtle.  The armbands are fine, although probably hot as they are made of a rubbery vinyl.

There were a few things I noticed to be issues. First, the blue color skirt faded somewhat quickly. That was disappointing, as I needed to wear it several times. I wouldn't have expected color fading. The boot covers were ridiculous and I didn't use them at all as they didn't stay up and were quite bulky. The cape was quite tight around my neck, and I consider myself to have a neck of average size. The ""bracelets"" were poor quality and I ended up purchasing metal ones.","01 5, 2014",17327,967

Wish they had a better way to keep those up (or you might make a mod yourself) and this outfit would be a 5 star.

I read all of the reviews prior to purchasing the costume and many people said the sizes ran large, but I told myself that I would rather buy something that's large and alter it then be stuck with something that doesn't fit. So I looked at the size chart and selected a large based on the measurements they put down for the bust. It said that the large would fit those with a bust size of 38-40 inches, but the dress was falling off of my chest even though I wear a 36DD. It was also way too big around my waist and hips. I personally altered the dress and took in approximately 2 inches from each side (total of 4 inches). I also had to alter the wrist bands because they were a total of 3 inches too big for my wrist. After altering everything, it looked great on, and everybody loved it. But I suggest if you're purchasing this costume, buy a size smaller than you would typically get, and save yourself the trouble of either altering it or sending it back.","11 1, 2013",11569,894
3670,4,A3HEW3D3JZDQ9S,B000EE1NNA,"The outfit tends to run big and also stretches, so an extra large will fit anywhere from 14-20 probably. I am average breast size, and I took mine to a taylor to have the sides of the breast area taken in, so if you are larger up top, you will have no problem fitting into this one. The downside for me was that the outfit is very square, and I am hourglass shaped, so it made me look ""boxy,"" although everyone else thought I looked perfect. It's plenty long and is made of good quality, considering it is a halloween costume. The extras that come with it (crown and arm cuffs) look cheap, so I recommend getting the gold crown and cuffs that another distributor carry. The boot covers are great if you already have a tall boot to wear them over, but if you're foot is larger then a 7, you will have a couple inches of your actual boot showing at the toe, which isn't really a big deal. Overall this outfit is great for the money, and for a few extra dollars, you can get the crown, cuffs, and wig and win that costume contest.","10 31, 2013",19483,589

I'll pair it with nude fishnet hose and some red heels. But be aware of the size issue. I always get a large in halloween costumes and I haven't had anything be so big on me.

In fact, I think they are smaller than the mini wonder woman outfit she has! I will definitely have to pull them apart and put some velcro closures to make that work, as they have no give to them, and ripped open the first time I tried to squeeze them past my petite hand. Secondly, the ""boots"" are not as they show in the picture, a sort of vinyl texture. They are actually a faux velvet to match the top, and definitely not sized even remotely for an adult. I understand I have a size 10 foot and that may be unusual for a size 6 woman, but I wonder if these things would even fit a size 6 foot, and even if so, they would never stay up anyway. Another reviewer called them leg-warmers. Yes, after about 5 seconds, they are around your ankles. Ended up buying boots to replace that.

I am very curvy and thick and I weigh 215 lbs even though I don't look like it since I'm athletic. People might say that I look like I weigh 180; thus, the large fit me loose. The upper body part fit perfect since my breasted filled the cup area, but the skirt is too long and big. The skirt is made from this stretchy metallic material and the whole costume doesn't look like the picture displayed. The headbands and slip on boot covers fit me well. The cape on the other hand is too small and its made from the same material as the skirt. The cape didn't fit my neck properly it will fit someone who's a size smaller. The hand cuffs are way too small and didn't fit halfways. And finally the belt is made from the same metallic stretchy material as the skirt but it doesn't look that great. With the velvet material the upper body part is made of the belt slips up or twists and it doesn't hold in place. Overall probably it will be a good costume for a child but not for an adult. Instead of making me look sexy it made me look sloppy.

I am 5' 3"" and 107 lbs, 32A and the top bulged like a bubble in the back and ruffled on the sides. Safety pins weren't enough- the chest was still loose and the sides were still bulgy. The belt was loose too, and attaches by velcro (with no varieties in tightness). The cuffs are loose, but not terrible- a thin, foam material with shiny metal fabric on top that are also difficult to lose their flat shape from shipping. Too bad they weren't just shiny spandex like in the picture.

Cape and boots are not as pictured- cape has a large, unadjustable neck (as oppose to the choker-like one in the picture) and just hangs back from your throat feeling like a loose choke. Boots tops are velvet with an elastic strap meant to go under your arch, and are also kind of loose. The velvet material makes it look Santa- themed. I wouldn't use it with this costume.

All in all, an XS is much too large for a 5'3"", 108 lb person. I wasn't able to tweak it to work. If you have basic sewing skills, then this costume would work. The top is attractive velvety and the skirt is shiny and not too short. It is definitely a more modest costume if that's what you're going for, and if you can get the right size. Order a size down.

The reviews I read here said the sizes ran large and to get one size smaller than you usually would, but I am a size 8 and the small was too small, so I should have gone with the medium.

3707,3,A3VFE2PJUDFWZ,B000EE1NNA,"Amazon sent me a XS when I ordered a S and did not have the correct size in stock, so I purchased this exact same outfit from another online Halloween costume site. Luckily that other site was able to get it to me by the morning of my event. This review is just on the costume, based on what I received from the other site...

I'm a size 8 and followed other reviewers' suggestions to order a size down. My chest is on the larger side and this still fit very well. The foamy tiara and cuffs are ok, but I purchased the metal ones and they were MUCH nicer! The boot cover things that come with this costume are a joke. I bought ""Funtasma by Pleaser Women's Halloween GOGO-305,Red/White Stretch Patent"" from Amazon to complete my outfit instead. The gold V belt is not attached, so it moved a lot during the night. I would definitely try to find a way to attach it before wearing this again. Another reviewer also mentioned adding a hook and eye closure at the top of the zipper, which I did because the zipper does not ""lock"" closed at the top.

With all the changes and additions I made, I ended up with a 5 star costume. As purchased, I'm giving this 3 stars.","11 25, 2012",11929,411

3800,5,A3EPX79AGP1TN7,B000ER9V68,"While I say it is somewhat large, it is not excessively so.  It is actually more between 'fit as expected' and 'somewhat large'.  I ordered a medium for my daughter (5'8, 130 lb) and it fit her almost perfectly.  A little looser (meaning, not skin tight) and a little longer than expected.  The 'little longer than expected' was a positive as this costume was to be for her to get extra credit at school.  The skirt in the picture shows it a little shorter than I think would have been allowed for regular skirts in school, so the fact it was a little longer than the picture is a good thing!

While it came packaged in a plastic bag, the quality was much better than I expected for the price.  It does not seems as though the fringe will be falling off, which is good.

The dress is slightly low in back, but not excessively so and the front is pretty modest.  The straps of the dress have fringe on them (didn't notice it in the pics).

Overall, very impressed with the quality of this product for the price.  Very good value.

Will update with how well it wore while my daughter was at school.  She has to wear it to school for a 'prohibition party' in a class, so I will know exactly how well it holds up.","11 1, 2016",11013,734

She is 5'3"" tall and weights about 105 pounds.  The costume fit perfectly and she said it was very comfortable.  I had purchased California Costumes in the past, and had knowledge of what a quality costume they make.  This costume was just as pictured in the description and it was a great hit with my wonderful bride.  The costume held up well, and I was able to fold the costume back up and put it in the original packaging again and we will use it for a Halloween event sometime in the future.  California Costumes really does a great job.  We currently have three California Costumes, and I would definitely purchase from them again.  Their fit guides and descriptions are consistent with the actual product, and the quality can't be beat.

It is ridiculously too short, I can't lift my arms or bend over or barely walk without my butt being seen. The fringe hangs down so it's not that obvious until I move. Also the dress description says the headband was included and the bag the dress came in said there was a headband but there is no headband.

3902,4,ALNSVR8X2JKKL,B000ER9V68,"I bought this costume in an extra large, even though I wear a large normally.  It was still a little snug, but with some stretch it was still comfortable.  I got the black one and felt really ""Flapper-ish!""  The feather on the headband wasn't very large, so it didn't stand up much, but it was comfortable, too. It was a great costume for my dinner/event at a good price.  I can wear it again, too.","11 21, 2015",16005,876
3903,5,A1LSK2QDFXVHO4,B000ER9V68,"So the dress is exactly as pictured and described. And I'm actually really happy with it. HOWEVER. Because of other reviews, I was afraid to order the dress true to size, since so many people have said that the dress runs small.
I am 5""5, 116 lbs, have a small chest and usually wear a small in everything. But I ordered a medium because that's what all the reviews said to do, and the dress is definitely too big. I'm actually fine with it, because it's just a little too baggy and long which actually gives it more of a genuine 1920's look (clothes kind of hung on women back then and were not form fitting).
So, all in all, I would say that if you are looking for this dress to fit you right, and maybe be a little sexier, buy the size you usually wear. If you have some time before the event you're wearing it to, you can always send it back and re-order if it's too big/small.
As far as the product goes, I'm very happy with the quality and everything about the dress. It smells horribly of chemical plastic, so give it some time to air out. And the headdress, as everyone else has mentioned, is sparse and could use some TLC if you're wanting a really snazzy headpeice. But I'm wearing it as is because I think it's just fine.","11 18, 2015",13111,892

One of my concerns was that the material would be cheap and the fringe would be too sparse. Neither were the case! I'm 5'5, 150 lbs, generally wear a size 10 dress, and I bought a size Large. It fit perfectly, but any smaller around the hips (mine are 40"" around) would have been a problem.

I did a spot clean under the arms and hopefully, in the future, I will have an opportunity to wear it again.  After reading reviews, I ordered the next size up from what I normally would wear.  I am glad I did, as in the hip area there was no room to spare.  Because of the fringe sewn around the dress there is no ""give"" in the material.

I read other reviews which stated this dress ran very small and was short and even recommended to order a size up which made me nervous because according to the measurements on the size chart, this never would fit me with the size i had ordered. I tried it on anyways and I'm glad I did, the X-large fits me perfect and I'm not easy to fit, especially with dresses. I'm 5'7, a 38 DD and more broad across the shoulders with a rectangular torso, like no hip indentations lol but the X-large is dead on, not tight at all, i'm comfortable and have extra room. It hits about 2.5 inches above my knee which i wouldn't consider ""short"" with my arms at my sides my finger tips is about the length of this dress. The only thing I will say is yes it is more fitting around the hip area as this dress is supposed to be like a sheath dress, if you are more hippy or pear shaped, this may not work for you or size up. The head piece that is included is nothing special, elastic with sequins and a feather, kind of scratchy to wear.

I follow the other reviewers and bought a size larger than I normally wear (I am 5'2 and 160 lb) because the reviews stated that it run small and kind of thigh on the hips area, and my size X-Large fits fine, maybe a tad loose on the hips, but then again I am not big on the hips/butt area.  It also might be a bit long for some people (it hits right above my knee, nothing like the model on the picture, but I am 5'2) , but I think that for me it is what I should wear.

The dress is awesome, although you may have to wear a black tank underneath, or perhaps shorten it a smidge in the shoulders, in case it fits a tad too low. I expected the headpiece to only be okay, which it was, so I ordered a separate, Gatsby inspired, head piece on amazon . I also ordered strings of pearls on amazon, T-strap shoes, a black and white feather boa, and a cigarette holder. I purchased fish net stockings locally, which I thought might be too much, but it was just the right touch of a detail detail to make the costume ""complete."" Overall, this is a great foundation piece for a flapper costume. I told my daughter it's one to save for costume parties in years to come.","10 16, 2014",8912,58

So glad I did! The dress fit like a glove!  Since I'm short, I ended up taking in the top of the shoulder straps just a tad because it hung too low for me, but the dress was beautiful. Great quality! I got lots of compliments as well!  It came with the headband and necklace and looked super cute!  The fringe goes all the way around the dress. Not just in the front.

I hadn't realized the chart itself was so skewed. Therefore having access to a size chart would not have helped at all. I probably needed an XXXL

I called her and mentioned that to her, and asked that she review her size,  Of course that was an INSULT.

Anyway, when I did not hear back I ordered her original request size.  The pico-second I hit the buy button the phone rang and she said OK, get the bigger size.  Amazon was great about cancelling the first order.

Just got an email yesterday, ""The dress arrived, thank you.  It is HUGE.  I think I can use safety pins to fix it.  I know I should have gotten the smaller size.""  Talk about a poke in the eye, when I bought her the damn dress!

The dress probably seems tighter than it actually is because there's no zipper, so you have to wrestle the dress over yourself. Since the dress was cheap,  I ended up getting it altered to have the waist taken in, and it looked great after that.

However, after having it altered and then wearing it once to a party, most of the threads on the dress started to fray and come apart. To me, this was definitely just a one-time use dress. I wouldn't wear it again.","12 22, 2013",977,743

I bought it thinking that if it was a little too small it would be fine for the children's dressing up box. So will wait till my youngest hits  about age 9 and then she should fit into it! No joke.

My husband had to help me get into it and because the hips were so tight in the dress, the costume ended up being ridiculously short, so that I had to wear bike shorts underneath to keep it from being obscene! I'm pretty sure flappers were known for loose-fitting clothing, not tight, constrictive clothing. I'm also pretty sure the modern woman could probably not fit into a real 1920s dress, so the size definitely needs to be adjusted. I would not order from California costumes again because of this.","12 9, 2013",12264,108

4307,5,A28B74513PGTXY,B000ER9V68,"I purchased this for a last minute costume (grey scale silent film star). Firstly, I read all the reviews and ordered the small assuming it would fit me b/c the majority of reviews state that it runs small or even extremely small. This is very relative. This is definitely not a junior's small, and arguably a women's small. It was too big on me and frankly, I felt really silly on Halloween but had no time to take it in since I received it that day and had my kid's costuming to contend with as well. Here's my size info in case it helps:

5'5""
103 lbs
32 B

As for the quality, it's pretty good for a bagged costume. You're definitely gonna lose a few strands of the fringe but the slink and drape are good and the under-construction is plenty sturdy for the weight of the fringe. It's not going in your washing machine, but it's a much better look, feel, and quality than the average costume in this price-range. I give it 5 stars, the misunderstanding on size was my fault, not the costume's.","11 25, 2013",15991,601

It gave me hugged every curve that I didn't know I had and it made me feel so amazing and so sexy! I know my smile must have been from ear to ear at the party that night I got so many compliments, I really felt like a movie star!

It was a little loose in the top, but looked fine.  I received a ton of compliments on this dress at a recent 20s themed murder mystery party.  This dress is also longer than most of the other flapper costumes out there.  It was only 3-4 inches above my knees and I felt well covered.

For the price it is a really nice costume that got a lot of attention because it looked nice and it's just an easy costume to buy accessories for with very little money. I really liked the touch that the little headpiece added. It is true that the dress fits tight around the legs, I have to admit I deffinitely did a shimmy dance getting into a small but in my case I wanted to go for a sexy flapper look and decided to go with the small not medium.

Wearable, but at risk of tearing the dress in public, so I slit the dress up the sides and wore a skirt under it, which worked fine for me since I was on a deadline and didn't have time to order a large.

For the price, this costume is actually great. All the seems didn't line up perfectly, and it did shed some of it's fringe, but I don't think I could've done better for the money, and I know it would have cost me more to make something.

You can dress up the dress with a feather boa and gloves that you'd have to buy separately, which I prefer more over an entire costume that has the gloves and boa... I'd prefer to buy it separately.

This thing is a HUGE help with that. It is thick and super warm. It is also bulky, so if you want to look slender around the house this is not going to help you with that. It runs large and the fabric is very thick. But it is seriously warm. The house can be 57 degrees and I'm comfortable in this, with leg warmers, a poly fleece nightgown, and warm slippers.

The Medium is perfect for him. For reference, he is 5'7"" and has pretty broad shoulders and chest, and the robe wraps around him with room to spare. It reaches about mid-calf.

I don't think this is a robe to wear when you get out of the shower.  This is a snuggly, watch TV, sit-by-the-fire kind of robe.

I ordered the Large in the Almond color.  I'm 5'6"", with short legs, and about 130 lbs. with average measurements for that height/weight.  I like plenty of wrap-around in a robe, so the size large is perfect for me, but some people would think it's too big.  A medium actually would probably fit me ""normally"" without so much wrap-around.

When I have it cinched around my waist, the length is about 2 inches above my ankles.  The sleeve length is great for me, but I guess some people would think they are a little long, since I got the Large.  They go over the top part of my hand, and I have normal-length arms.  They could be rolled up, too, if you wanted.

I am keeping it because it will serve my purpose for wrapping up and reading, watching TV or lounging.  It is very very warm, the fabric is thick and plush.  It is not the soft fluffy fleece or microfiber you will find in the malls.  If you get warm very easily or live in warm climates, this will be too heavy.  If you want to feel like you are snuggling in a cloud and staying toasty warm, then this is perfect.

The armholes are generous, the sleeves long enough to turn up should I want to  do some chores.  The lapels are nice and wide and the inner tie actually is long enough to tie and of the  same material as the robe, so no cold satin against the skin.

4502,5,A2EWF2OWK60DJW,B000EVEAS8,"This is the robe I've been looking for.  I had ordered a verrrry thick (and equally long) terry robe a few weeks earlier and just found the extreme weight of it to be offputting every time I reached for it.  I thought - I do need the warmest robe (and full ankle length) I can find, but does it really have to be SO heavy?  Then I went searching and found THIS robe - got it today and it envelopes my body wonderfully just like the terry robe, but it's LIGHT.  Thick, plush and light.  I am every bit as warm, but far more comfortable, and it has a really good quality fluffy texture -- doesn't look cheap or tacky as some micro fiber or synthetic robes I've seen which have more of the look of fake fur or a skimpy uneven pile or a ""trailer trash"" look; grungy, old and lived in from day one.  No, this robe looks luxurious and evokes a spa, and somehow as thick as it is, it even manages not to make you look enormous, that part was a surprise.

The only thing I would wish if for another 2-3 inches in length.  I am 5'9"", 140 pounds, and ordered the large. I really couldn't go with X or XX Large just for more length - the bottom of the robe comes to 7 inches from the ground (or 3 inches from my ankles) - pretty much like the photo of the man - it doesn't come as far down as the one the woman is wearing (clearly she's shorter).  I get that robe makers can't please everyone and I'm somewhat tall for a woman so they can't make robes long enough for me that would drag the floor for other women. But I wish it was longer anyway.  I do feel the draft on the few inches of my exposed ankles.  And no I don't want to bend my aching back in the morning to struggle with pulling on socks in the morning before I have my coffee.  The whole point of a robe and slippers is you just stumble groggily and slip easily into them and done - an all-in-one solution.

First, there is the swimmingly large fit in the size small. I did not catch on to the unisex sizing until too late. Second, a problem occurred with the first wash. Because the robe arrived with a faint chemical smell I immediately washed it, separately, so the color would not run. My high efficiency front loading washing machine could not perform its spin cycle due to the weight of the water in the fabric and the unbalanced load. So the whole sopping wet mess had to be wrung out repeatedly over the next two days and finally air dried for a few hours in the dryer and overnight outside.

However, nearly everything else didn't work for me:

1) I ordered the red color and it looked faded, not nearly as rich and lush as the red shown in the picture, it was more like rust. Not a big deal if color doesn't matter for you. It just bothered me that I paid 85 dollars for this and it looks ratty out of the box. I would advise getting a lighter color like the lavender.

2) Next, while the length was exactly what I was looking for, the width of this robe is extremely wide. I wear a women's size 4 pants and this robe has just too much fabric to fit comfortably. It is bulky on me. What's weird is that the arms were an exact fit, so if I went down a size to X-Small, I think the arms would be too short.

All this to say, it would have been worth the money for me if the fit was more precise. If that were the case, I'd just send it back with a color change. Needless to say, it's being returned for full refund. My search for a full length robe continues.","11 25, 2013",13048,315

4551,5,A2ZI4NXK28F2R1,B000EVEAS8,"I am very pleased with the robe's warmth, soft touch and weight and fit, but I would love to be given the option of a tall size for robes.  I do understand the difficulty this represents to companies, but maybe there could be an un-hemmed version that we could take to the tailors.  If un-hemmed robes were available, we would have the ability to make it the garment full length and keep our ankles warm.  Cold feet are one of the main problems for many people, and a full length robe is a much more elegant look than one that is cropped at the ankles.  Of course, if it came un-hemmed, one could also crop it at the ankles if that is the desired length.

I expect this robe will wash and dry like a dream, too, although I haven't tested it yet since it is a gift.  The only other suggestion I would make is that I would love to have options of having an option of maybe a few very feminine robes with gorgeous A lines with flattering colors (like this cranberry color) suitable for new mothers and Valentine's Day and Mother's Day and Christmas, etc., to remind women of their feminine beauty without sacrificing cozy!...with matching slippers!!!","10 23, 2013",4551,535

4621,5,A1QOK9LU90ACF7,B000EYDK7M,"Briefly, I had a childhood accident 30+ years ago that caused arthritis in my foot.  Not bad, but a constant, nagging pain sensation that I learned to just live with.  Finally, I saw a podiatrist who referred me to a pedorthist to be fitted with footwear that could alleviate my pain.  I wound up with a pair of Birkenstock sandals and I've never turned back.

They're great.  No more foot pain, period.  I wear dress socks and the sandals to work everyday (in an office environment -- I got flack for that from co-workers, but the needling didn't bother me and management never took me to task, either), to church, everywhere.  I've a different pair of Birkies for the beach and lawn work -- not as comfortable as the suede uppers on these Arizona's.  The mocha suede straps have held up wonderfully despite getting wet and lightly soiled from time to time.

Admittedly, it's a lot of money to spend, but the shoe store my pedorthist works in re-soles the Birkies for about $30, and will replace the cork and sole both for about $50.  The re-soled sandals last about a year, but remember, I wear them daily and I often walk a few miles each day.

In short, these sandals have dramatically improved the quality of my life and foot arthritis is no longer any concern for me.  Not bad for a little more than $100.","12 26, 2006",4022,370

The silicon is thin.  That wouldnt be so bad if the plastic belt clip and the armband did not use that as the means of holding on the the IPod.  The thing feels like if I were to jump hard enough the IPod would fall out or would tear the silicon.

In my opinon, if you are planning on getting this case as a means for holding your IPod while working out or for the use of the belt clip do not get it. This thing is too cheap to hold on to your 250 - 350 dollar ipod. But if you are looking for a cheap functional case for your IPod so that it does not get scratched, go ahead and get it.","09 28, 2006",459,825

It is a little more costly with the shipping, but you get the armband, etc. etc.  Haven't used any of the accesories yet.

TIP:  If you're putting this case on a brand new iPod, peel up the original plastic protecting the front of the iPod and cut just below the screen.  This way, your screen will still be protected in the original packaging and you can save the screen protector they send for a replacement.

I do wish it covered more of the silver part near the USB and the armband holes in the back, but hey, obviously I understand you need to be able to plug it in and get the armband through. The hold switch and headphone cutouts are perfect.","09 19, 2006",14040,793

4716,4,A1MA1AU70CW3OM,B000FIWCZ8,"The watch winder works exactly as described. I think this is a good value product. Especially when compared to the multi hundreds dollar watch winders on the market. It does look a little bit plastic. But the winder is well built and is reasonably quit when turning.

It comes with 4 different timer settings and 3

different turning direction settings: left, right and alternating.

I calculated the number of rotations per day based some measurements.

Setting:

  A:  rotate 33 seconds, rest 12 minutes:  300  rotations/day

  B:  rotate 10 minutes, rest 90 minutes:  660  rotations/day

  C:  rotate 30 minutes, rest 3 hours  :  940  rotations/day

  D:  rotate 1 hour, rest 3 hours  :  1700 rotations/day

I use setting B for my watch with ETA 2824 movement. Every watch has a specific requirement as of how many rotations per day it needs to remain fully wound. See you watch specifications.

The winder does not come with the possibillity to run on batteries, that is a pity I think.

As I just bought it I can not say anyting about long term reliabillity but assuming it keeps on running I think this i a very good buy.

I got a Chris Matthews-sized tingle up my leg as I anticipated the angry red welts that the metal bands would give me as they smacked my tender flesh.

Alas, even after inserting and removing these shapers numerous times in three separate pairs of engineer boots, I have been unable to get them to do anything but effectively and elegantly hold my boots' uppers in an upright position.

4733,1,A2IBEH42D8NPO8,B000FSIFC2,"I purchased these boot shapers because the price seemed very good. As I should have predicted, you really do get what you pay for. The shapers are two pieces of pink plastic connected by two strips of metal. The strip of metal are curved and attached (in the most ineffective way you could ever imagine)to each piece of plastic. You are supposed to squeeze together to place into your boot and then release to maintain the shape of the boot. All of this is wonderful in theory, but the poor construction precludes easy use of the shaper without constantly having to reinsert the metal strips into the tiny little clips cut out for them in the plastic. This is a waste of time and, as some other users have noted, quite dangerous. I think you could seriously injure yourself with these if you got a flying strip of metal in the face as you're trying to put it into your boot. I put them into my boots facing away from me, but the metal strip still flies out and scares me 1 out of every 2 times I use it. Next time I will invest in something better constructed and less dangerous.

4737,5,AXIREN7N6IF4A,B000FSIFC2,"This is a great invention!  Contrary to the other comment these are easy to operate if you have a little common sense... the spring-like action is in the center of the shaft of the boot shaper; therefore you should squeeze the whole thing together at that point while putting it in the boot... duh.
You just pop them in and your boots stand right up like they were on a mannequin... a great idea if you ask me.  They come with a hanger attached to the top loop of each boot shaper that stays hanging down but if you wanted to hang your boots up in your closet the hanger would come in very handy for that.
You really cannot beat the price either.  I hate it is not PRIME shipping available as I am a prime member but I have done business with shoebuy for years under Amazon and outside of Amazon and they are great.  Very fast and friendly.

4758,5,A2O87MS5QCJ4Y3,B000FSIFC2,"Recently, I purchased one pair of Boot Shapers at a big bed and bath store and loved them; but at $10 a pop, I knew this could get pricey buying 10+ pairs (and I didn't want to buy them one at a time with the 20% off store coupon).  I had been using rolled up newspapers, after awhile they get broken down and need to be replaced. I really love these.  They are simple to use and look great in white. Not only do they keep all heights of boots (from booties to thigh highs) up straight, the way they are made, allows for air to circulate all the way down to the toe area.  Without these, the boots fold over and there is no way for air to get down inside and freshen them up, definitely beats my primitive newspaper option.  Also, there is the cleaver alternative to hang them with the attached hook. Love this company, my package was received before the seller's earliest anticipated delivery date. These Boot Shapers are awesome, you'll regret it later if you don't buy more than the one pack of three.","04 10, 2013",18470,432

The only problem I have is that the hanger faces the wrong way, and if you turn the boot shaper so it faces the correct way, the boots are not shaped correctly. This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Nevertheless, it still works great on the boot rack since the hanger is a flexible plastic. I worry that the plastic may eventually break since I have to twist it to the correct direction to hang it on the boot rack. I also bought the boot bags (from Bootique) but 2 of the 6 bags had broken zippers and it was a struggle getting my boots into the bags so I would not recommend buying the boot bags.","12 6, 2012",3870,759

The rod has enough resistance that the boot is sturdily held upright perfectly.  To place inside the boot you simply squeeze the shapers while pushing them down into the boot.

I contacted the seller and they explained that this shirt is not available by neck size like they advertised.  They look at the size you order, and send you the size they think is the best approximation of what you ordered.  Had I known this up front, I never would have placed the order.

I just returned from a 15 day cruise and there were 3 formal nights. On the first night, the shirt fit fine. Half way through the cruise on the second formal night, the shirt collar was feeling tight. On the 14th night, and final formal night, I left the collar button undone and used my bowtie to keep the collar closed.

The collar button extends a bit and when I tried it, I was still able to close the shirt comfortably.

The shirt comes with perfect looking black plastic studs-you can use them, or your own, or the buttons and buttonholes built into the shirt(invisible if you use studs). The cuffs are button only. The pleated front and collar are perfect, as in the picture. As some people reported, the body of the shirt that is invisible under the jacket is somewhat light/see-thru but the fabric is strong. I wore a white teeshirt under the shirt which allowed me to take off my jacket when things got late and informal and I looked perfectly acceptable.

4966,5,A2HWIB3OA6T3KF,B000G01UBW,"My husband has to go to many black tie optional and black tie events for work throughout the year.  We finally sprung for a tux and I was looking for a formal shirt that was nice, yet not crazy expensive.  This one fit the bill.  I was not expecting much due to some of the reviews but the most recent reviews looked positive so I ordered. On Amazon, I always go by the most recent reviews because that carries more weight to me than one from 2009 or so.  My husband  is  5'8, 42 inch waist and wears a 20 neck 34/35 sleeve, so I chose the 20 34/35 on Amazon as the option.  When took it out of the package, this shirts tag just says ""4X' on the inside (but their sticker on the onside of the package said 20, 34/35). He tried it on and everything was perfect but the neck was a little large (before adding a tie). Just a little bigger than he liked, leaving a little gap.  However, sleeves, belly area, everything fit PERFECT besides the neck being a little too large.  So, I washed the shirt in hot water and put it in the dryer and the neck is now absolutely perfect. Fits him 100% now.  The shirt looks great and fits like a dream.  The quality is great for the price.  Also, I took the advice of another review and bought these&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cufflinks-and-Studs-Set-for-Tuxedo-Formal-Black-with-Shiny-Silver-Trimming-by-Men-s-Collections/dp/B004NKD3J8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cufflinks and Studs Set for Tuxedo - Formal Black with Shiny Silver Trimming by Men's Collections</a>&nbsp;button studs and cufflinks.  The button studs that come with the shirt are very cheap plastic and on the small side (as you'd expect for free) and you could get away with them for a one time event like a wedding or formal event, but if you will wear the shirt over and over I'd go for nicer studs. Also, I had no quality control issues.  All the stitching is just fine -- the shirt was not thin as one review said. We are very pleased. This was a FAR better buy then going to big and tall shops here all over town looking for a tux shirt that would #1 would fit and #2, still spending $75 or $100 on it locally.","09 6, 2014",1657,403

However, when it arrived, the neck size was perfect but the arm length was off and the body of this shirt was HUGE! As another reviewer stated, ""I was swimming in it.""

I should have given more attention to the one review that said ""they look at the size you order and send you the best approximation of what you ordered.""

5129,5,A5KRM3621UHG1,B000GHMRLW,"I love these, but THEY DO SHRINK considerably lengthwise, so order them long:

I had three pairs of these that fit perfectly when I first got them, but after several months I noticed my ankles were drafty.  I got out the measuring tape and my nominally 30"" inseams (which started out closer to 31"") now measured just 28"".  This happened to all 3 pairs after maybe 15 laundry cycles.  I wash and dry them in compliance with the laundry label, and they do just fine, but they apparently come out just a tiny bit shorter each time.  (I have not noticed any shrinking of the waistband; they only seem to shrink noticeably in length, thankfully...)

They're very comfortable pants, with sufficient room in the crotch and thighs to let you sit and crouch and move around without restriction, so I ordered three more pairs in the same exact colors---but this time with a 32"" inseam.  I measured the inseams when I received them, and found them all to be a little under 33 inches in reality.  I then washed them, and this time I intentionally dried them in a hot drier to speed up the shrinking process.  Sure enough they are all already a full 1"" shorter, at around 32"" now.

I expect these 3 new pairs to continue to shrink over the next six months in the normal laundry cycle until they are about 3"" shorter than they started, which is 30"" and perfect on me.  (That's 3"" total shrinkage from the 32"" inseam, which when measured was actually 33"" to start with.)

So do buy these pants---you'll love them---but buy them 2"" longer than you usually wear.  Then just give them time (or a few hot dryer cycles), and they will shrink to your perfect length.","12 17, 2017",12144,555

The material is heavy duty, but light for summertime in Florida comfort. Also these pants look dressier than jeans, the color is much fuller than the pix show, real deep color. Very nice, I hope that these will get looser over time. the rest of the fit looks sharp. These wear like iron, I have gotten this pant for years. The more you wash em the better they look and fit. I would recommend keeping the packaging and getting a size up as there has been a rash of too small Carharrt items lately, and with that said it is still worth the trouble to get ahold of these canvas slacks.

He loves the way that they curve! So over the years, I've continued to purchase these pants for him along with the same style shorts with the same pockets.  It really breaks my heart that the shorts are no longer available to get.  He worries that he won't be able to get the pants one day as well... so please keep on selling them.

My boss is very upset about that too! I've even called Carhartt head quarters trying to see if they would just make him several years supplies for him but they could not do it! :( I pray that these pants will stay in stock and not be unavailable because my boss will not be a happy man and neither will I because I will have to listen to him complaining everyday about his work pants like he is already complaining about not being able to get the shorts anymore because they are not making them anymore!

But I wish the cell phone pocket on the right side were bigger and more secure. The other Carhartt pants I own have a deeper phone pocket and a shallow fabric ""lip"" that prevent the phone from sliding out. Honestly, that pocket is the reason I bought another pair of pants from this company.

However, the phone pocket in this pair is about a half inch too shallow for my Nexus 6. My phone falls out EVERY SINGLE TIME I sit down on my office chair, every time I depress the gas pedal in my car, every time I move my right leg to any angle that is more than 90 degrees to the floor. This is a deal breaker for ""work"" pants. I've only worn these pants for one day and I've already almost broke my phone twice. I really like my phone and I don't like the sound it makes as it bounces off concrete...

I know this pocket probably wasn't designed just to hold a phone. But let's face it, 95% of people are going to stick their phone in there.

Do remember to check Carhartt's guides as the ""Regular"", ""Relaxed"", ""Loose"" aren't just the diameter - they affect where the belt sits. Above, at, or below the natural waist.

I'm also not sure where they get these pants sized because they are far from correct. I wear a 32 waist jean and 32-33 waist in slacks. I first ordered a 34 waist after reading others having size problems. I could not even get them over my hips. Sent them back and got 36 waist. They barely fit and since they are cotton I know once I wash them they won't fit. Guess I'm going to have to get a size 38. Which is way off from my normal 32 inch waist in all brands of jeans. The length seems to run about an inch or so long but you can shrink them. So length isn't really a issue.

When we got these he was kind of sceptical about them. I washed them of course and there was a little shrinking but nothing like others I have bought that were made out of the same material. They are a canvas type material that my husband loves because it is tough by he don't get so hot at his job. No one likes swamp backside lol. These fit perfectly and he was very happy. He does wish they were a tiny bit more breathable but overall even on the 125 heat index days which in his job is closer to 150 degrees that he stayed cooler then regular pants. The color is spot on with what we expected. The only complaint he has for his scissors that he has to use for work we have to make the side loops smaller. He does love there is two so he don't have to worry about just putting on the one side it he is working and in a difficult position to put in the one loop. The pockets are holding up perfect as he is tough on them also. Overall he is very happy with this purchase and will be ordering more.

I'm willing to pay brand name prices for these because I know they're durable but is it too much to ask to take the mens carpenter pants and add a little bit of ease in the hip?

The second pair (navy blue) I already bought before I wore the first pair and they were also too long but not like the first pair, both pants exact same listed sizes (the labels), it was this product so they are both the same line, same model just different colors.

I've never had the listed inseam so wrong this tells me they have zero QA process and I want to let people know, I'd stay away at all costs.  Both pairs unwearable, did not match at all the listed inseam, and also the pairs were different lengths from each other, what's going on?

Additionally I need to be able to straddle roof ridges for wok and without hiking these up over my belly button there was no way to accomplish that.

Love the material and Carhartt has such great customer service I hate to complain but if they could cut these like the #101118 jeans that'd be awesome & I'd buy 4-5 pairs and wear them to work every day. So far I've found this to be a problem with Carhartt's products designed for work. Very tight in the pocketed area and very high cut. Different material but basically cut like mom jeans.","05 11, 2015",13201,642

It still fits too snug for my liking and I need to go up two inches in the waist for comfort - which is going to be almost 3-4 inches above what I wear in other clothes. Also the zipper is not very long so there is not much room for the stuff down there...and I am a very average sized guy but I can tell before washing these pants that we are going to have a problem with the lack of room in the zipper area.
Now the pants look and feel great, nice and light, good length, they are sort of baggy in my opinion but not much at all, just loose fitting. So I will try again with a larger size or try the regular fit.","04 17, 2015",14789,290

6107,5,A38J867MLU7PR7,B000GHMRLW,"Every pair of jeans I own is a 40 waist (which for me is about a half size to big) and I like the way they fit. I tried these on at a local store and I couldn't even fasten the 40 waist. They didn't have a 42 in the store so I ordered a 42Wx32L from Amazon and they fit me exactly how I would have expected the 40 to fit. From the sounds of other reviews it appears to me that the closer you get to a 30 waist the more true they fit. So, choose wisely.  Comfortable light material and they seem to be constructed very well. The Canvas really just feels like thin denim. The real reason I'm reviewing these pants is to let my fellow ""big men"" out there know that if your like me and have bigger muscular thighs and have a hard time finding truly loose fitting pants, look no further. I have tried on dozens of supposedly loose fitting jeans from every brand imaginable with nearly all fitting me like 80's style 501s (or rodeo style Wranglers for the country folks). These are the baggiest pair of pants I have owned since me beloved Silver Tab Baggy and Lucky 48 ""Fat Boy Fit"" jeans were discontinued. Now if Carhartt would just make this cut in a standard 5 pocket jean with some nice dark washes I be set for life. I do feel compelled to warn all the slim guys out there that, your little birdie legs will probably be ""swimming"" in these jeans and I'd go with Carhartts ""relaxed"" fit instead. (A little side note to the big men. I have also found that Wrangler 20X style 33 ""extreme relaxed"" jeans also fit me and my bigger thighs well)","03 20, 2015",2159,81

The fit/cut is excellent. If you love the old Levi's 560 (Loose Fit) before Levi's started using cheaper materials, less quality control and changed the cut, you will love these pants. They are extremely comfortable.
On the downside, they are incredibly prone to wrinkle up. I need to iron them after every time I wear them (which is obviously ridiculous). In fact, even after a couple of hours, you already see very visible wrinkles. No other pants I have ever had needed anything like this. I wish the firm fixed this. I believe there are fabric treatments that can greatly help this and are not too costly.","01 31, 2015",5378,796

These pants from Carhartt are not only functional and durable, they're damn good looking. The colors they come in are neutral, but attention grabbing. I've already had a few people ask me where I got my pants from. They go good with pretty much any shoe/shirt combo.

I've got kind of a thing for Carhartt ever since buying the best cold-weather hoodie I've ever owned from them last year, and the fact that these pants are as good as they are has solidified my business with them I think.","09 23, 2014",13048,315

6375,4,A13BHNLBPVWAYH,B000GHMRLW,"I like carpenter pants for the pockets - they have more utility than ""cargo"" pants, for me. To work I've been wearing Wal-Mart store brand carpenter jean, 15 bucks a pair, because I like the pocket configuration and they are cheap, but I wanted something more durable. Wranglers were out - they only have one leg pocket!

These run a bit tight in the waist - I ordered two inches larger than my typical waist size and they fit perfectly out of the dryer.

The right hand side leg pocket has a reinforced seam at the opening, which makes the clip of a multitool or folding knife a bit snug to slip on or off. But it won't get frayed or torn up anytime soon. Typical carpeter pants have a ruler pocket with diagonal opening and a square tape measure pocket on the right side, but these have the reinforced cell phone pocket. It works ok for my purposes, it's where I clip my leatherman tool and stow screwdrivers or wrenches if I need a free hand and don;t want to set them down (I always lose track if I set them down somewhere.)

The left pocket is a more traditional sewn on square of cloth, like traditional carpenter pants. It holds a small flashlight just fine, and a flat cell phone.

These pants have hammer loops on both legs, not just the left leg like most carpenter pants.

The canvas duck fabric is lighter than I expected, which IMO is a good thing, but still seems a lot more durable than the denim you get in most jeans.

I am disappointed at how small the right side ""change"" or ""watch"" pocket is, compared o most carpenter jeans. Items that ride comfortably in the watch pocket of my other carpenter jeans either don't fit, or ride up and dig into my side, if I stick them in the change pocket of these pants.","05 7, 2013",15485,203

6407,5,A9SELXRSOHQ3W,B000GHMRLW,"Because of other's reviews of this product I had some difficulty choosing the right size. Some reviewers said that they needed to order several sizes larger in order to get the right fit so I initially ordered a size 35x32. I'm a tall, skinny guy and I typically wear pants with a size 32 or 33 waist. 35 turned out to be about three inches too large so I exchanged them for a size 33, which fits comfortably, but definitely requires a belt. I think a size 32 would have fit perfectly. The exchange process was quick and simple and the new size arrived faster than my initial order. I would recommend that other customers buying these pants order the size they usually wear and make an exchange if those don't fit. As of writing this review, I have only worn these pants long enough to determine the size and fit. I may write an update later with my experience of their quality, especially if it turns out to be lacking.

EDIT: 12/13/13, They continue to be excellent. Keep in mind that if using these for work darker colors will be less prone to stains and dirt, however, even Carhartts in lighter colors clean up well.","06 10, 2012",6446,663

6409,5,A2BXKUS799U1RC,B000GHMRLW,I'll start by saying that the sizing is def. different than other brands. I was hesitant to purchase these online after reading the reviews about the sizing problems. I decided to buy them anyways and was prepared to exchange them if they didn't fit. I normally wear a 34/32 but ordered a pair of these in 38/32. When I receieved them and tried them on they were a little big in the waste but nothing a belt wouldn't fix. After washing and drying them they did shrink a little bit. I have to say that these are the most comfortable work pants I have worn. When they say loose fit they really mean it. They are very roomy but not to the point where they are baggy. They also have a few handy pockets for a utility knife/screwdriver or even a cell phone. I just placed an order for 4 more pairs in various colors so I have a pair for each day of the work week. The only problem I have noticed is that they seem to come out of the drier very wrinkled but it is not a big deal. Overall I would reccomend these pants.,"03 30, 2012",16809,200

6527,5,A5KRM3621UHG1,B000GHRZN2,"I love these, but THEY DO SHRINK considerably lengthwise, so order them long:

I had three pairs of these that fit perfectly when I first got them, but after several months I noticed my ankles were drafty.  I got out the measuring tape and my nominally 30"" inseams (which started out closer to 31"") now measured just 28"".  This happened to all 3 pairs after maybe 15 laundry cycles.  I wash and dry them in compliance with the laundry label, and they do just fine, but they apparently come out just a tiny bit shorter each time.  (I have not noticed any shrinking of the waistband; they only seem to shrink noticeably in length, thankfully...)

They're very comfortable pants, with sufficient room in the crotch and thighs to let you sit and crouch and move around without restriction, so I ordered three more pairs in the same exact colors---but this time with a 32"" inseam.  I measured the inseams when I received them, and found them all to be a little under 33 inches in reality.  I then washed them, and this time I intentionally dried them in a hot drier to speed up the shrinking process.  Sure enough they are all already a full 1"" shorter, at around 32"" now.

I expect these 3 new pairs to continue to shrink over the next six months in the normal laundry cycle until they are about 3"" shorter than they started, which is 30"" and perfect on me.  (That's 3"" total shrinkage from the 32"" inseam, which when measured was actually 33"" to start with.)

So do buy these pants---you'll love them---but buy them 2"" longer than you usually wear.  Then just give them time (or a few hot dryer cycles), and they will shrink to your perfect length.","12 17, 2017",7227,938

The material is heavy duty, but light for summertime in Florida comfort. Also these pants look dressier than jeans, the color is much fuller than the pix show, real deep color. Very nice, I hope that these will get looser over time. the rest of the fit looks sharp. These wear like iron, I have gotten this pant for years. The more you wash em the better they look and fit. I would recommend keeping the packaging and getting a size up as there has been a rash of too small Carharrt items lately, and with that said it is still worth the trouble to get ahold of these canvas slacks.

I found this style of work pants for him and ordered them many years ago and now he won't wear anything else but these!! Nothing even comes close to them.  He's very hard to please and when he said that he loved these...it really made my day! :) Everything about them...he loves but the pockets are the real deal for him!  He loves the way that they curve! So over the years, I've continued to purchase these pants for him along with the same style shorts with the same pockets.  It really breaks my heart that the shorts are no longer available to get.  He worries that he won't be able to get the pants one day as well... so please keep on selling them.  If anyone knows where I can get the Carhartt Men's Canvas Utility Shorts....please let me know!! I've searched the whole internet and still have not been able to locate any of them anywhere :(!! My boss is very upset about that too! I've even called Carhartt head quarters trying to see if they would just make him several years supplies for him but they could not do it! :( I pray that these pants will stay in stock and not be unavailable because my boss will not be a happy man and neither will I because I will have to listen to him complaining everyday about his work pants like he is already complaining about not being able to get the shorts anymore because they are not making them anymore!

I'm docking one star because the sizes are all wrong. I have size 36 waist pants from other brands, that are a looser fit than the 2 pairs of size 40 Carhartt pants I bought. Size 40 fits fine, but Carhartt's ""36"" would have been impossible for me to wear. The company should really look into correcting their measurements. Just a head's up.","06 20, 2017",6899,84

Also, the seat feels a bit cramped when sitting.

But I wish the cell phone pocket on the right side were bigger and more secure. The other Carhartt pants I own have a deeper phone pocket and a shallow fabric ""lip"" that prevent the phone from sliding out. Honestly, that pocket is the reason I bought another pair of pants from this company.

However, the phone pocket in this pair is about a half inch too shallow for my Nexus 6. My phone falls out EVERY SINGLE TIME I sit down on my office chair, every time I depress the gas pedal in my car, every time I move my right leg to any angle that is more than 90 degrees to the floor. This is a deal breaker for ""work"" pants. I've only worn these pants for one day and I've already almost broke my phone twice. I really like my phone and I don't like the sound it makes as it bounces off concrete...

I know this pocket probably wasn't designed just to hold a phone. But let's face it, 95% of people are going to stick their phone in there.

Disappointing. I'm not going to through the pants out but I can not wear them for work.","05 8, 2017",953,353

6898,3,A11PKMA6UV05WG,B000GHRZN2,These are comfortable pants. They are 100% cotton so I'm not sure how long they will last if you are doing outdoor work or looking for a pant that will be rugged. I'm also not sure where they get these pants sized because they are far from correct. I wear a 32 waist jean and 32-33 waist in slacks. I first ordered a 34 waist after reading others having size problems. I could not even get them over my hips. Sent them back and got 36 waist. They barely fit and since they are cotton I know once I wash them they won't fit. Guess I'm going to have to get a size 38. Which is way off from my normal 32 inch waist in all brands of jeans. The length seems to run about an inch or so long but you can shrink them. So length isn't really a issue. I suggest if buying to be prepared to way over size the waist size by at least 3-4 inches.,"11 12, 2016",17178,598

When we got these he was kind of sceptical about them. I washed them of course and there was a little shrinking but nothing like others I have bought that were made out of the same material. They are a canvas type material that my husband loves because it is tough by he don't get so hot at his job. No one likes swamp backside lol. These fit perfectly and he was very happy. He does wish they were a tiny bit more breathable but overall even on the 125 heat index days which in his job is closer to 150 degrees that he stayed cooler then regular pants. The color is spot on with what we expected. The only complaint he has for his scissors that he has to use for work we have to make the side loops smaller. He does love there is two so he don't have to worry about just putting on the one side it he is working and in a difficult position to put in the one loop. The pockets are holding up perfect as he is tough on them also. Overall he is very happy with this purchase and will be ordering more.

I'm willing to pay brand name prices for these because I know they're durable but is it too much to ask to take the mens carpenter pants and add a little bit of ease in the hip?

7430,2,A2MLR1EYA02R5K,B000GHRZN2,"I bought two pairs of these because I know my exact size which is usually enough to buy without needing to try the pants on.

The first pair I got, Mushroom, were much longer than the listed inseam, I'm stepping on them every step, so either I return or pay for the them to be tailored.

The second pair (navy blue) I already bought before I wore the first pair and they were also too long but not like the first pair, both pants exact same listed sizes (the labels), it was this product so they are both the same line, same model just different colors.

I've never had the listed inseam so wrong this tells me they have zero QA process and I want to let people know, I'd stay away at all costs.  Both pairs unwearable, did not match at all the listed inseam, and also the pairs were different lengths from each other, what's going on?

Love the material and Carhartt has such great customer service I hate to complain but if they could cut these like the #101118 jeans that'd be awesome & I'd buy 4-5 pairs and wear them to work every day. So far I've found this to be a problem with Carhartt's products designed for work. Very tight in the pocketed area and very high cut.

Also the zipper is not very long so there is not much room for the stuff down there...and I am a very average sized guy but I can tell before washing these pants that we are going to have a problem with the lack of room in the zipper area.

7505,5,A38J867MLU7PR7,B000GHRZN2,"Every pair of jeans I own is a 40 waist (which for me is about a half size to big) and I like the way they fit. I tried these on at a local store and I couldn't even fasten the 40 waist. They didn't have a 42 in the store so I ordered a 42Wx32L from Amazon and they fit me exactly how I would have expected the 40 to fit. From the sounds of other reviews it appears to me that the closer you get to a 30 waist the more true they fit. So, choose wisely.  Comfortable light material and they seem to be constructed very well. The Canvas really just feels like thin denim. The real reason I'm reviewing these pants is to let my fellow ""big men"" out there know that if your like me and have bigger muscular thighs and have a hard time finding truly loose fitting pants, look no further. I have tried on dozens of supposedly loose fitting jeans from every brand imaginable with nearly all fitting me like 80's style 501s (or rodeo style Wranglers for the country folks). These are the baggiest pair of pants I have owned since me beloved Silver Tab Baggy and Lucky 48 ""Fat Boy Fit"" jeans were discontinued. Now if Carhartt would just make this cut in a standard 5 pocket jean with some nice dark washes I be set for life. I do feel compelled to warn all the slim guys out there that, your little birdie legs will probably be ""swimming"" in these jeans and I'd go with Carhartts ""relaxed"" fit instead.

You can wear them for days at work before having to switch to the next pair. I have 3 pairs now and never run out doing laundry once a week. Just hang them up after a day of work and put them right back on the next day with a little dirt on them, but these colors make it hard to see.

The fit/cut is excellent. If you love the old Levi's 560 (Loose Fit) before Levi's started using cheaper materials, less quality control and changed the cut, you will love these pants. They are extremely comfortable.
On the downside, they are incredibly prone to wrinkle up. I need to iron them after every time I wear them (which is obviously ridiculous). In fact, even after a couple of hours, you already see very visible wrinkles. No other pants I have ever had needed anything like this. I wish the firm fixed this.

These are not absurdly baggy, but they do give just a bit of extra room there so I'm not squeezed.  Very comfy.  The material is a little stiff at first but softens nicely.

This undesirable effect is much more pronounced in the darker colors (e.g. Navy blue or black).  The pants looks old after just a few washings because of the inconsistent color loss.

After a few more washings, the material starts to fray, tear and deteriorate along the edges of the pockets and at the bottom of the legs.

It's happening with most products. Packages have become smaller, quantities are less, etc. to keep the price the same. I purchased these very pants 2 years ago and the fabric is MUCH thinner, although it says canvas. I have struggled to find a durable work pant in my size, and thought Carhartt was my best option until now. Unfortunately, Carhartt has discontinued my size, therfore I thought I would buy all 3 pair. I also ordered from another supplier who indicated that they could not fulfill the order due to the size being discontinued. I do not plan to return these because they fit.

7773,4,A13BHNLBPVWAYH,B000GHRZN2,"I like carpenter pants for the pockets - they have more utility than ""cargo"" pants, for me. To work I've been wearing Wal-Mart store brand carpenter jean, 15 bucks a pair, because I like the pocket configuration and they are cheap, but I wanted something more durable. Wranglers were out - they only have one leg pocket!

These run a bit tight in the waist - I ordered two inches larger than my typical waist size and they fit perfectly out of the dryer.

The right hand side leg pocket has a reinforced seam at the opening, which makes the clip of a multitool or folding knife a bit snug to slip on or off. But it won't get frayed or torn up anytime soon. Typical carpeter pants have a ruler pocket with diagonal opening and a square tape measure pocket on the right side, but these have the reinforced cell phone pocket. It works ok for my purposes, it's where I clip my leatherman tool and stow screwdrivers or wrenches if I need a free hand and don;t want to set them down (I always lose track if I set them down somewhere.)

The left pocket is a more traditional sewn on square of cloth, like traditional carpenter pants. It holds a small flashlight just fine, and a flat cell phone.

These pants have hammer loops on both legs, not just the left leg like most carpenter pants.

The canvas duck fabric is lighter than I expected, which IMO is a good thing, but still seems a lot more durable than the denim you get in most jeans.

Some reviewers said that they needed to order several sizes larger in order to get the right fit so I initially ordered a size 35x32. I'm a tall, skinny guy and I typically wear pants with a size 32 or 33 waist. 35 turned out to be about three inches too large so I exchanged them for a size 33, which fits comfortably, but definitely requires a belt. I think a size 32 would have fit perfectly. The exchange process was quick and simple and the new size arrived faster than my initial order. I would recommend that other customers buying these pants order the size they usually wear and make an exchange if those don't fit. As of writing this review, I have only worn these pants long enough to determine the size and fit. I may write an update later with my experience of their quality, especially if it turns out to be lacking.

EDIT: 12/13/13, They continue to be excellent. Keep in mind that if using these for work darker colors will be less prone to stains and dirt, however, even Carhartts in lighter colors clean up well.","06 10, 2012",18371,930

I decided to buy them anyways and was prepared to exchange them if they didn't fit. I normally wear a 34/32 but ordered a pair of these in 38/32. When I receieved them and tried them on they were a little big in the waste but nothing a belt wouldn't fix. After washing and drying them they did shrink a little bit. I have to say that these are the most comfortable work pants I have worn. When they say loose fit they really mean it. They are very roomy but not to the point where they are baggy. They also have a few handy pockets for a utility knife/screwdriver or even a cell phone. I just placed an order for 4 more pairs in various colors so I have a pair for each day of the work week. The only problem I have noticed is that they seem to come out of the drier very wrinkled but it is not a big deal. Overall I would reccomend these pants.,"03 30, 2012",9356,986

7820,5,A9HTLX12BC8TK,B000GKPYSW,"I have been shopping for a dress skeleton watch for some time and stumbled onto the EE Dorado. I'd not heard of this company before, so I checked their website (they are a long-established German watch manufacturer), so I took a chance. This watch is a BEAUTY! It's far and away the best looking ""skel"" I've found for the price, and if the almost $800 retail price is to be believed (MSRP on watches is highly inflated), then this watch is a steal. The only other watch I was considering was an Android with a metal bracelet (an entirely different look) and at almost twice the price. I did notice there is no country of manufacture shown anywhere on the watch or the packaging. Although this is a German company, it makes me wonder if they are making these in China or someplace overseas. I've got only a few complaints-the clasp is difficult to open/close and the gold hands can be difficult to see (no contrast with the gold mechanism and no illumination). However, I'm so mesmorized by the sheer elegence of this watch, I really don't mind. Beautiful wooden box, too! A real keeper that I'd highly recommend. The vendor was also very prompt with shipping-it even came insured.","09 12, 2007",13913,107

It took a little while to get used to it, but now I think it's the only style of buckle I'd have on a watch. No more dropping the watch on the floor when trying to put it on and it also keeps the leather strap from wearing out at the buckle. The watch also comes with an impressive wood gift box.

7825,5,A1CHDNBEB5VPM2,B000GKPYSW,"Pros:
I bought this watch as a gift for my father and he loved it. In terms of looks, the watch is probably one of the most amazing ones that I've ever seen; It's defiantly far better than any of the mechanical / skeleton watches currently on the market. I looked at hundreds, but this one caught my eye. It's the most ""skeletal"" of the watches, while still retaining elegance.
The picture does not do it justice, it is even nicer in person.
It is shipped in a nice box that has the watch presented on a holder when opened. It defiantly adds to the beauty of the watch.

Cons:
The second, minute, and hour hands can be a little bit hard to see, as it is gold on gold. Some people could have a hard time reading it.
As other people have mentioned, it is not as heavy as it looks.
It is a bit pricey.

Conclusion:
This watch is one that i would recommend buying. It is unlike many that I have seen and would make a great present or nice watch for yourself. It costs more than a lot of watches out there, but it's also a lot cooler than most. In reality the price is cheap compared to other high-end watches. If you're thinking about getting it, i would say go for it, you won't be sorry!","03 31, 2013",15753,996

The few complaints people had such as the weight and the fact that 4 is written incorrectly as IIII were both accurate however they do not make the watch look any less fancy or cheaper. Everywhere we go he gets compliments and it works and looks fantastic so I don't see any negative things to say about it.

The company also got the watch here faster than the expected delivery date which was impressive considering I ordered it during the holiday season.

One reviewer from Moscow says, ""be carefull when using the watch in dangerous places because it will atract (sic) attentions and seems very expensive. That could get you to be robbed with such a shiny thing in your wrist!""  I'm not sure about the situation in Russia but I am inclined to believe that his fantasy is working overtime.  It is a beautiful watch.  I loved this watch and would have kept mine if it had been a larger size.  Because of the size it is definitely an understated watch.

People whine it's light weight, pointers are difficult to see...hey weight is no problem.  Do you want a droopy arm that is sore from a heavy watch?  If it weighed more you would then be complaining about your sore arm or the discomfort of a heavy watch wrapped around your wrist.  Those who complain about pointers difficult to see...again this is the nature of a skeleton watch.  You KNEW this when you ordered it if you looked at the picture and you wouldn't have ordered it if you didn't look at the picture.  The picture definitely has the ""WOW"" factor.

I admit I got carried way in the reviews and the photo of the watch and my imagination sailed away into the wild blue yonder.  Hey, 40mm is 40mm.  Even a 43mm watch is not big but it does show a presence to the wearer and is likely to get noticed.  Again, this is a 40mm watch.  It is a very beautiful watch and you can easily get mesmerized looking at the skeleton workings that are exposed on top and bottom.

I got it for my husband, and he loves it!... He usually likes them thinner, (this one is a little bit bulkier than his usual liking) but this is not for every day, so it's ok!

Watches run accurately. It is not clear from the producing country. Not convenient to fasten the strap. Too much light, on closer examination it is seen substandard treatment details. Watches are protected from moisture? In general, satisfied with the purchase.

7839,4,A1YJ1YOW2PLX1S,B000GKPYSW,"This is the sort of watch that will be noticed!
Some will love it, some will hate it and that is seen in these reviews.
Mixed reviews and for a good reason:

This is a beautiful watch, design is awesome, weight is somewhat light but it doesn't feel plastic and that's because it's stainless steel. Not heavy, like some reviewers mention but it i think that makes this watch very confortable exactly because of that.

At this price, i thought it was a good purchase, and i'm very happy with it.
Keeps good time, mine doesn't loose that many minutes as some said but this is not the kind of watch you look for accuracy, it's a fun watch to wear and in that case, it's very cool.
It's flashy, too much perhaps. I agree that this watch seems very ambitious since everyone will notice that golden ""thing"" in your wrist and it certainly seems like a expensive watch.

It has indeed a chinese movement so this is not that great jewerly many were saying it should be but it's not expensive and as such i think people are beeing a bit harsh when saying this is not a high quality piece. You get what you payed for: a fun, cheap enough watch that looks awesome. Design is above all other qualities with this watch but that's ok for the price and i can't find anything like it anywhere! That's great! :) It is unique and impressive!
You will not find another watch in this price range that looks like this. Compact and nice to look at, perfect for parties! ;)

Like our friend from Moscow says, be carefull when using the watch in dangerous places because it will atract attentions and seems very expensive. That could get you to be robbed with such a shiny thing in your wrist!

Pointers are difficult to see in anything but good light but then again, you buy this watch for looks, not function. ;)
Not the easiest watch to wind because crown is too close to case but other than that, i have no complaints.
Nice to have in your collection unless you only like superior, non chinese watches.
Very happy with my purchase, seller was very fast in sending the watch and arrived in perfect condition. Like many said, the wooden box is a delight and i use it ( as manual describes ) to keep some of my unused watches.","10 26, 2009",14035,55
7840,4,A347HX124QWBA2,B000GKPYSW,"The Dorado watch by Eric Edelhausen looks beautiful. Truth be told, I bought the watch on looks alone. I wanted a big, flashy watch. I assumed (you know what they say about assuming) that all watches kept decent time. I got a big, beautiful, flashy watch. It's self winding, which is a very nice convenience. However, its timekeeping leaves something to be desired. It gains and loses minutes over the course of a week or so. The variance never seems to exceed +/- 5 mins, but if time is of the essence the watch isn't as dependable as it should be for its price. If you do a minute check once a week and make the small adjustment as needed, you'll have a real eye catcher. I'm very happy with my purchase. The ten seconds a week I spend correcting the time is far outweighed by the aesthetics of the watch and the fact that I'll never need to buy a battery for it.","04 3, 2009",14115,315

Too big, too shiny, too ambigiuos - both in the nature of the watch manufacturer, and the time. On the side note,  I am afraid I might get robbed with this shiny thing on my hand. ( I live in Moscow) Considering all the minuses, it is an interesting prototype to have in your collection.","02 18, 2009",14358,708

7843,5,A3CILHHGVA1ZAW,B000GKPYSW,"Actually I bought this watch for my wife, as her and myself are watch collectors. I have several skeleton watches, and she loves them. She told me that she wanted a skeleton watch, she also wanted an automatic watch. I went to searching since her birthday was coming up soon. Well I went ahead and showed her a pic of the Eric Edelhausen Dorado watch, she said oh I love it. Then I knew I was getting her the right watch. The watch arrived just a couple of days later, she was blown away by it. It is one of her favorite watches. Why do watch companys not make more skeleton watches for women ? I highly reccomend this watch to both men and women. Women now are wearing larger watches these days. My overall experience with Amazon was top notch. I would buy from them again if I see an item that I need. Thanks again, Amazon","08 7, 2008",14646,972

This is without a doubt the sharpest looking watch I have ever owned and I can't believe the number of compliments I get every time I wear it. I do have to admit that I am not easy on any of the watches I wear; yet this has held up beautifully. We recently purchased another one for our nephew and it was the number one hit gift item at his college graduation party. For good looks, terrific quality and a wonderful value, I recommend it highly. It also comes with a nice wood gift box.","07 5, 2008",6090,597
7845,3,ABB85NCAY9RZJ,B000GKPYSW,"I saw the watch and base on the pictures , was very captivated by it. I personally own a BAUME MERCIER Capeland model and was expecting a awesome piece.  here's my thoughts:  I do agree with some reviews about the weight..it feels very light , like there is no substance to it...almost ""plasticky"".  For a retail of $798..I was expecting a heavier watch.
  Other reviews are correct about the time hands blending in with the background...IT IS VERY HARD TO SEE THE TIME.  buy this more for the look , because you will definitely have a hard time see the time hands.
  The packaging is nice with a nice box. The phamplets and manual are very simple, nothing special. No country of origins on anything it comes in. NONE, NADA, ZILCH.
  I actually contemplated sending it bsck because i was dissapointed at first, i decided to wear it for a few days so be sure.
  I found that IT IS VERY EYE CATCHING. people will ask you about it and if you need a conversation starter...this will work. I actually grew to like it and am keeping it. For $198 ( what I paid ) it's not too bad for a watch piece...i don't know if this will be an HEIRLOOM PIECE, i doubt it, but it is nice looking so for sentimental value it does have an appeal.
  It is now part of my wardrobe with my other watches. if you are looking for a skeleton watch, this is not too bad of a choice...it will do fine. If you are expecting too much...this may not be the watch for you.
  but $198 for this watch is fair.  I guess I will recommend it.","06 26, 2008",8323,949

The  packaging is beautiful --- but the watch is quite lightweight --- fine for some I guess - but I expected a more substantial piece. The case is clunky and not particularly aesthetic in design. But for the price? Well I guess what you pay for and for a couple of hundred bucks, I guess its OK... on the other hand I would have serious doubts as to the worth at the claimed RRP, sorry, and I certainly don't conssider it an ""heirloom watch"" Am I being harsh? I really don't think so","06 25, 2008",2692,572

As it is it's not super fluffy, see pictures.  Shes 21"" around the ribs and 26"" from the top of her shoulder to the top of her knee. Also, I don't know if the description says this, I didn't know it would have the option, but the straps can detach on the back side so that you can cross them in an X if you need to do so.

7898,2,A2C7EM0U41KIXF,B000H2PMMW,"Very nice shirt, but ran WAY too small no the neck.

Advertised size is a bit deceptive, too, since 1/2"" neck sizes are advertised, but not really available. I ordered an 18.5"", but received a 2XL, which also said 18""/18.5"". Had I ordered an 18, it would have been the same shirt.

An 18/18.5 normally is 18.5"" (just as a 34/35 sleeve length really means 35"").  Except this one was even smaller than 18"".  And that was before laundering. No way would it fit someone with an 18.5"" neck.

(Beware, too, that this shirt does not have French cuffs, which any formal shirt should really have, especially a wing collar one. I was aware of this when I ordered, so did not discount my review for that.)","02 13, 2018",7908,847

I'm 5'11 190lbs 34"" waist.  Semi-sorta' athletic dad build.  I had to tailor 2.5 inches off each side of the torso. I took another 1.5"" out of the sleeve. If your wearing this under a vest you'll need to get fatter or get a tailor.

I purchased a Large at first and had to return it for a Medium. I am usually a 16 1/2 neck and 32"" sleeves for my 5' 7"" 170# frame. I found that the Medium shirt (15 1/2 neck and 32"" sleeves) was still a little baggy from under the arms to the waist and little too big in the neck. It also ran a little long. I had it cut flat at the bottom to reduce length and the amount of shirt tail in my pants. Also had sides altered to fit me better. I guess that was about $15.

Well what a surprise when I got this shirt.  The neck and sleeve sizes fit exactly as expected.  The Pique Bib Front was uniform on both sides (the manuafacturer obviously fixed this issue after all of the bad reviews) and although the shirt is a little thinner than some of the other tuxedo shirts, its not as bad as it was described.

I'm a big guy, usually wearing a size 18.5 - 19 collar. (46 - 48 waist, and I'm only about 6 ft.)  Fearing, that this might run a little small, I went with a sized 20 collar with a 34/35 sleeve.  First off, I was super impressed and happy that this shirt was actually made in that size, so THANK YOU.  That said, the shirt seemed a bit bigger than expected and needed some tailoring to get it right.

In the neck area, I had a little room, making the shirt very comfortable.  Additionally, the sleeves were cut perfectly.  However, the rest of the shirt fit me kind of big and I had to have my tailor both cut the length of the shirt (probably about 3 or 4 inches!) and take the shirt in about 4 inches.  That said, I still ended up with a beautiful, high quality tux shirt, for a very good price.  I would definitely recommend this shirt!","05 22, 2016",1657,403

Seriously though, what is it with dress shirts?  I'm not a stick by any means but there is an extra foot of fabric around the waistline.  Since I have a 36 waist, that means you would need a 48 waist for this to fit properly.  To top it off, all of the fabric that is not in the bib is completely see through.

like silk, etc.

I fit in the top half fits mostly ok. the ""apron ties""  are loose and hang. I have a 38 DDD chest and they lay limp. So I will be reattaching them so it lays nice.
The bottom half fits OK but pulls a little.
The packaging says for the XL size it fits up to size 22. I don't think it would. It's stretchy but the slit might rip and you would probably look like you're in a maid sausage casing. I should also say I tried it on while wearing spanx and a corset. Chest measurement 45"", waist 37"" and hips 52""
My proportions are off for where the waist line hits. It's almost a drop waist on me. And its surprisingly short. I'm short so I figured it would be about knee length. Its easily 4"" above the knee. and then there is the slit- which is almost panty flashing. So I'm wearing a yoga boy shorts so I'm not flashing.
Costume is a kind of cheap but it will work. I wish I didn't spend nearly $50 on it- isn't worth the price. If I hadn't decided to throw a RHPS party in 10 days I probably would have looked elsewhere or asked a local seamstress to make a costume.

For halloween or on a budget I suppose you could work with it- gently shake some powder into it to dull the shine and pick the curls out just a bit. Otherwise, spend a little more ($20) and get a better synthetic wig- this is junk.","07 30, 2015",14035,55

I bought a red garter belt to wear with them under my elf outfit, and I thought they would be really sexy.

The length of these was perfect for me, and the fabric was nice and soft, but the fit around the top of the thigh highs was so tight I almost had to take them off.

They were quite tight around my thighs, which at first was a bit uncomfortable, but then I got used to it and they were fine. I think the fact they are tight prevents them from falling down when you are walking around a lot. One thing though is that when I sat down they all of a sudden rolled down a bit, so I had to adjust them when I got up. The fabric was comfortable and not too warm, but they are opaque so you don't have to worry about them being see through. They are not perfect, but they served their purpose well and the price is great here on amazon.

PROS:
-Stayed up for hours of walking around.
-Comfortable fabric, not itchy or too warm.
-Opaque

CONS:
-Quite tight around upper legs, will possibly leave some marks.
-Roll down a bit if you sit down.","10 29, 2012",4677,985

I picked a very cute red/black pair, and it went great with my outfit. It was indeed rather tight at the very top, but I found it to become less bothersome as the day went on (I'm not sure whether they stretched out or I just became acclimated to them). They stayed on pretty nicely and securely, and did not find them rolling down. However, at the end of the day, they were still somewhat uncomfortable enough such that it was a relief to take them off. For me though, that's not too bad, and worth the cuteness~","09 28, 2012",15540,971
8445,4,AUELDBGJ1VRA6,B000J3ROES,"As with most other stockings, thick legged girls may have trouble with these as ""one size"" works until the thigh.

They roll themselves down after awhile of wearing them and they do make my thighs look a little chunky. I'm only 120 pounds and it does make me mildly self-conscious but I found wearing a cute garter belt with them keeps them up and makes my legs look nicer. :) For sure worth the purchase all and all.,"09 5, 2012",10795,890
8447,4,A1O9YP1YPXIATI,B000J3ROES,"I just recieved the Leg Avenue Women's Nylon B/W Striped Stockings, One Size Fits All. They are exactly as described and I'm VERY happy with them. I just wanted to add a couple little extra notes:
--they came across as pretty opaque (90-95%) but I'm also so pale I'm almost see thru...so whether or not the white would stay 'white' on me was never an issue. I do wonder that anyone with a really dark skin tone, if there would be a subtle difference. I haven't got anyone handy at the moment to test that theory so I just thought I'd put it out there for others to mull it over. I also have skinny legs (calf is 15"" and above my knee is 17"") so they are not stretched much. But they are listed as stockings NOT tights, so I expected all this.
--I'm also 6 ft tall and 157 pounds and (with the aforementioned leg measurements) the stockings made it to 2 inches over my knees. They seemed to stay up for the test walk around the house...but the event I'm getting them for is not for a while so I can't say how long they'll stay up or if they stretch much.
So pretty much the only reason I took off one star was because they are hand wash. Not that that's going to stop me from putting them in a laundry bag on gentle cycle (I DON'T do hand wash!)  ;)","07 28, 2012",5996,893

I understand, because of my size, that I would normally need garters for stockings, since stockings tend to bunch and roll down on me.  However, I have to wear these stockings just above my knees so they won't cut off my circulation.  I'm only a size 12, which is still in the ""average"" range, so why a ""one size fits most"" item won't fit an average-sized person is beyond me.

8540,2,A1R7VIAON5Y4DY,B000JOOR7O,"I've purchased these shoes before with good success, they lasted about a year before there was very visible wear and tear. However I purchased a recent pair back in Sept (2017), that December the fabric started to tear around the elastic on the left side of the right shoe.

I contacted the seller (Gbrandshop) about a warranty/refund but they sent me to Vans for that. Vans shut the case down outright, stating they only warranty shoes bought through their authorized resellers, I was asked to handle it through the Amazon shop. Back to Gbrandshop, they never responded to another email after the initial finger point.

I contacted Amazon and got the refund handled through their A-Z policy, Amazon is the clear winner in customer service here. Disappointed with Vans' customer service on this, the quality of their shoes (hopefully it was just a bad run), and especially the customer service of Gbrandshop","01 10, 2018",7908,526

The first issue, I ordered these in men's 11, I  am a 10.5, and surprisingly they were small. Not bad, I'll break them in, whatever.

The second issue, from day one they leak through the soles. The bottom up, soaked feet. Constantly. Of course it rained the first day I wore them out.

But I love these shoes, they are too small and they leak. No big deal until I'm at the game and I use the restroom and step in piss.

Style wise, these are simply great shoes. Function wise, these shoes (the ones I received from my Amazon order) were and are a failure.

Been wearing them for 32 years. from the beaches of California to the streets of D.C. even the canyons of Zion, Red Rock and North Rim.
I know they start a little tight, but stretch perfectly.
Great for Hacky Sack, summer days at the beach... and for causing new and interesting aromas when worn without socks, heheheh.
I wear 10.5 US Mens... these fit as expected. Always they start a bit snug. I wear them a few hours at a time until they stretch and get a little torn here and there.
Funny thing is, there is no real arch support in these things - and they only come in one width that I know of - and of course, I wear at least an E width in boots - and I have arches that rival any bridge... but they never make my feet hurt...?
.Only 5 stars for now...","07 27, 2016",11035,190

I tried a pair on in the stores thinking I would wear a 7.5 as that is what I would wear in my tennis shoes, but that was a bit too big and a 6.5 was just too small. The 7 that I got fit perfectly.

My left shoe has something like a flaw where the ball of my foot touches when I step down. It's not like that in the right, so I am assuming it's just a small flaw, but it's not a big deal. I am sure over time I won't eel this anymore.

Like Converse, I cannot wear shoes like this for too long. If I were going to walk for a long time I would not wear these shoes, but I have trouble wearing shoes with little support.

I do like them though! (Don't mind the cat hair in my photos, I can't bring anything home without cat hair clinging to it instantly as I bring it in!)","07 1, 2016",6331,851

Unfortunately, it was just past the 30 days return policy.  Now she has a pair of shoes too small for her and it seems like there is nothing that I can do.  The shoes are unworn (other than just trying them on for size) and in the original packaging...

He never complained about them hurting his feet.  But I decided to buy him the same pair in a size 10, and they are a perfect fit.  No complaints here.

9538,5,A2MNMEHE7YEI90,B000JOOR7O,"I am a big big fan of the Vans classic slip-on checkerboard shoe.  This is my fourth pair in my life.  I have had an olive green and black checkerboard pair, a turquoise/sky blue and black checkerboard pair and a black and white checkerboard pair when I about 12 years old.  I wish they would keep making the classic colors and stop phasing them out.  I especially like the styling of the black webbing between the tongue and the sidewalls.  This is my first all black pair and I'm really liking them.  The first pair of shoes I've ever had that I actually want to stay clean and looking brand new.  I really hope that Vans keep these classics in production forever!  I've become so addicted to the ease of the slip-on shoe.
The only down side might be that they are a bit tight on my toes and a tad uncomfortable and stiff at the beginning.  I know from past experience though, that they break in very quickly then they feel very comfortable.  Just be warned, if you wear them everyday, especially skateboarding, they will wear out quickly and eventually will wear holes in the soles","10 29, 2015",14646,972

It takes a couple months of constant use to get that nice faded look. Also, I traveled through South America and Asia for 6 months last year, and these shoes I wore almost every day while traveling, hiking, with socks, without socks, with shorts, and pants, and they look good and feel good every time.

A smaller size just won't go on because the opening is too narrow.
Returned the shoe and went to the store to try on a few more pairs and had the same problem. The salesperson said they're getting a lot of similar complaints lately.

If these get used on an infrequent (once or twice a week) basis, they stay looking pretty decent and last long enough. If you're the type that wants to wear these all the time, don't expect them to last more than a couple of months: by that time, the rubber soles will start to pull away and the shoes will look sloppy.

9684,4,A1LQCER30L1LWK,B000JOOR7O,"My only complaint about these shoes is that the left shoe is slightly more difficult to put on. The heel cup seems to be tighter or cut slightly differently. Once one, the shoe feels the same as the right, and there is no excessive rubbing or tightness around the heel. The left was a struggle to get on for a week or so, but it's getting easier. I have had several pair of the Vans classic slip-on, and I have never had this problem before. Oh, and the label tag at the back of the right show wasn't completely glued on because of the seam where the white band of the sole overlapped in the back. Not a major issue. I just put some super glue back there before I wore them around and it's been fine since. Maybe these were factory ""B' grade shoes, I dunno. Still, they fit well, I can wear them around without any problems, and they look good.

***They ask if these shoes provide good arch support. I said ""No"", because they aren't really built for that, probably due to the 'classic' design. I've had several pairs of this style shoe from Vans over the years and I don't expect them to provide the arch support of a sportier sneaker.

They are not high on the top of your foot, that's why even no show.socks can be seen you need something in the shape of a ped.

He's held on to the his last dress up shoes, but even shoe polish won't hide all the cracks.

So I got him these. They are comfortable. They don't look to preppy (why we avoided loafers). They go easily from dressy casual in SoCal or Hawaii, to dressy mingling with Oscar-nominated actors/directors.

These fit a little small from what I remember, and the construction feels different from Vans two decades ago.  It's to be expected.  I've been wearing these for a couple weeks and so far they wear fine.

9937,1,A28CJW71BE1HJC,B000JOOR7O,"I have been wearing the same type of sneakers for the past six years (3 different pairs, as I only where them to the pool on Saturdays/Sundays).  I always ordered them directly from Vans, although my son (who is an avid fan of Amazon; Scotsil@gmail.com, one of your most loyal and best customers, as he is a shopaholic) told me to order the sneakers from your site and, in fact, they were approximately $10 less expensive.  As soon as I got them, I checked the size (which was the same as I had ordered for my last three pairs) and then threw out the box, assuming (unfortunately) that they would fit.  After wearing them a number of times, I knew that they were way too big and were causing me back pain.  I therefore went to a local shoe repair shop and purchased pads (two per shoe, as the gap was so wide) to go on the back interior.  However, they are not working, although I do not believe they are a knockoff/imitation of a true Van's sneaker.  Please note that I rarely complain about these issues, especially when the amount in controvery is only $35.  However, it is extremely annoying as I threw out my old vans and now cannot wear the new ones which will require me to go to the store in the mall during this very busy Holiday Season.  I understand if there is nothing you can do to accomodate me but, if there is, it will transform me into the same customer my son is.  Thank you for your consideration.

If I order a half size up though, my heels will slip out of the back.  So, while the length of the shoe is true, the space between the insole and upper only allows for a pancake thin foot!  If these are the only shoes someone wears, it's probably because their grossly misshapen feet won't fit into normal shoes!

That being said, I did receive my shipment quickly.  The sizing on this page was very misleading, but I looked at shoezoo's website to make sure the size I ordered would be the size I received (they were the vendor that came up when I chose my size from the drop down).

I tied them in such a way that I could just slip them on and off, however the laces could still come untied every now and again. When they came in, I slipped them on and I was surprised at how comfortable they were. You're mostly paying for the insoles in my opinion. The outers sole is very similar to many of Vans' shoe models and this tends to wear on the toe and heel quite rapidly even when the shoes are only worn when walking. Other than that, they are great. Snug fit, and comfy. Also you can pretty much get them in any color you want.","03 24, 2012",7584,647

It was a very tight squeeze and my toes were a little cramped.  I am going to try to exchange it for a size eight.  I suggest actually going to a store if you can. I wish I could have.

They are easy to put on, take off, and there's no need to hassle with shoe strings. But when I received my pair a week later, they were size 7. I wear size 11 and a half. This was a problem. To be perfectly clear, after I had purchased the item (and realizing there was no shoe size drop down box online) I emailed the shoe company. I let them know that I wasn't sure if the random 7 in the title meant the actual shoe size or some other code I wasn't aware of. This number did not make it's size obvious, like other shoe purchases. After waiting, the company never emailed me back. So, I sent another, saying yet again that I am a size 11 just in case and that I would really appreciate it if they could confirm the shoe size for me. Unfortunately, no response. So, I gave them a call explaining my situation and their representative was glad to help and researched the shoe size for me and told me they had one last pair in stock in my size. With hopes that the last pair wasn't in their display case, he said he would gladly email a shipping label so I could return the shoes asap. I waited, checked my email, waited some more, checked again (over a weeks span, of course), but nothing happened. At last, I just gave up and gave the undersized shoes to my aunt to give to my cousin for Christmas. I would've tried and tried again (some more) to get my size shoes, but there was a two-week return policy, and by the time I had waited for their shipping label, or phone call, or email, two weeks was past overdue.

I have flat feet and a bit of arthritis in one foot. These shoes performed very well. I have thin heels so a tiny bit slippage but nothing too bad. I usually put orthodics in shoes but didn't need to with these. Lots of cushioning and overall support, great ankle support. They are not the most attractive shoe but they are decent. Kind of clunky in the back but don't mind being that they help my feet not to hurt. I would definitely recommend these shoes. They are very lightweight too, a good amount of room in toes and no breaking in needed!","10 31, 2012",9336,147

10095,3,A3190RJ4JEAO88,B000JRNAGK,"I have mixed-last feet that are very wide in the front only. According to the company's Web site, the extra wide is a WW - WWW, so I decided to try both a wide, supposedly D/E, and extra wide.

For the extra wide to fit correctly with my orthodics, I needed to take out BOTH insoles and change the lacing to bypass the lowest hole. Taking out the ""mosaic"" inner sole is a pain - the little pieces along the edges come off as you try to get a grasp on it - you'd think they'd design something you could grab onto, at least initially. I don't think it would survive being taken in and out multiple times for adjustment.

I can feel cushioning from the mosaic innersole - but it makes the shoe too tight - and I'm not sure how much good the mosaic would do if you could get it right. Maybe this would work if you're at a specialist who has a machine that can translate how you walk onto the mosaic and if you don't need the extra width.

I am probably going to keep them because they have a fairly straight last, don't seem to have an excessive rollbar correction - and because I'm desperate for a pair of shoes I can wear. I don't think they're worth the price premium.","06 1, 2010",9806,664

10357,1,A33GL4ZYIG97Q1,B000K2PJ4K,I have been buying Calvin Klein underwear for my little 4 year old grandson for about 2 years now. He is outgrowing his and ready for the next size. Calvin Klein underwear does run small and these are no exception. My grandson is about 43 inches tall and weighs about 44 pounds. He has been wearing the Small 6/7 for well over a year and is just now outgrowing them. Unfortunately I've had a really hard time finding these undies in a boys medium 8-10. I stumbled across these on Amazon and purchased them with high hopes. They arrived and they seemed just ok. I washed them and immediately noticed that they were not the same quality of his current Calvin Klein's. The material on these is a rougher and thinner. The waistband is an itchy nuisance to my grandson. So I'm thinking that these are either fake or their quality control needs an overhaul.

The size is just perfect and it can easily stretch if needed. The quality, color and everything is superior to brands with the same price tag.
If the size says 8/10. Then expect them to fit an average body size of age 8/10yo. If you cant tell whether your child is over the natural growth rate<which is a good thing> or not,  then don't order the size based on the age only and then complain.

They were all getting worn out in the elastic and too small (he was still wearing the 2T-3T).  I went back to the jury store to get him some more, and much to our dismay, they stop making the boxer briefs, and only had the regular briefs.  I was so disappointed as I didn't want to buy him the regular underwear, and I didn't want to go to just Walmart or Target and buy him some cheap boxer briefs that weren't going to last long either. So I did what I always do and I got on Amazon and started browsing their selection. I came across these along with another kind, and I ended up ordering two sets of these. My son was super excited because these match his daddy's LOL and they are very great quality as well, and exceptional value. 2 pairs for $8.99! We were paying $9.99 a piece (a little less if we had a coupon) at Gymboree once upon a time. These are Calvin Klein- way better! I have another little boy 2 years younger, so I am all about quality as we are passing everything down. I don't want to have to buy things twice if I don't have to.

He had been wearing Hanes, Fruit of the Loom but he needed to go up from a S to a M and we saw these on Amazon. He liked the color choices (this review is for the black and red, but there are many bright colors also) so I humored him; i.e. the initial motivation for the purchase was almost irrelevant.

The important thing is that he loves them for the soft feel, comfort and they are high quality. They are truly *super* soft and hold their shape.  We liked them so much we threw out his Hanes and Fruit of the Loom and bought him three more pairs of these, enough for a week.  They are more expensive but really are worth it.","09 13, 2014",18554,320

Note:  The directions say to not use fabric softener when washing them which would make the wicking less effective.  The instructions also say to wash the socks inside out which get a little annoying as some debris tends to stay stuck on the outside of the sock during washing.

11166,3,ABHU2X8LMRWL5,B000KKPX0C,"My shopping search was for ""THIN"" socks. I know better than to search for uncushioned, because then I only get cushioned socks in the search results.

Granted, the cushioning of these socks is minimal, so I decided to try them for my normal activities. Prior to the first wash, are a bit long in the foot for me, but I use Wigwam Ironman Triathalon socks in the same size and they are absolutely wonderful, in my opinion. Unfortunately, I can't seem to find them in the XL size in BLACK, like I can in white. When these socks popped up in my search for THIN black socks, I failed to read the entire description where it mentioned cushioned soles, so I took for granted they were thin. Alas, there are cushioned, so I had to make a decision.

I plan to give these socks a try, simply because uncushioned socks are nearly impossible to find, except for the very pricey high level athletic socks that crush my feet, or the long legged dress socks that cut off my circulation below my shins. I'm becoming desperate, so I'm willing to try anything, but I don't think these will do very much better than my previous experiences with cushioned socks.

In new form, the cushion lumpiness is bothersome... but maybe subsequent washings will remedy that. No threats of blisters, yet, but I haven't tried them in all of my normal shoes that I wear daily. They are warmer, but I have more problems with sweaty feet than cold feet, so that's no benefit, so far.

If these become the socks of my dreams, I'll amend this review and buy more socks, but if I can find the black Ironman Trialthalon socks in XL size, these will live with the other twenty-odd pair of cushioned socks in my ""backup"" sock drawer. There's only five pair in my daily wear drawer, unless I want to wear white... and it's neither Easter, nor Memorial Day... yet.","04 18, 2014",679,29

It is really hard to judge socks without wearing them for a long long time to see how they wear.  So far I have used these socks several times, and they are fine.  I do not have any serious issues with them.  I do feel a little bit that they might be a too thick because my shoes always feel tighter when I wear these, but they are comfortable.

I like wigwam as a brand because they had a manufacturing facility in the city where I grew up and my mom used to work there.  They always had quality products in my history with using them.  These are my first running socks from them and the quality still seems pretty good.  However, I have to admit that I liked both the Thorlo unisex Experia CoolMax Micro sock and the Balega Enduro Quarter lengh socks even better.  The Thorlo are now my go to running sock.

For the past few years I've been wearing Thorlos thick cushion running socks which to date are the best socks I've ever worn.  However, they are pricey.  Only a few dollars more than what I paid for these socks, but when buying 10 pairs at a time, a few dollars per pair can make a big difference.

I would say that these socks are superior to your average Hanes and Fruit of the Loom socks, but not ton much better.  They breathe, feel quite nice against the skin, and seem very durable.  But I don't think they're worth $10 per pair.  Maybe $5 per pair, $6 maximum.  They lack the cushioning that I desire and are a tad bit too big.

Overall, I think you're paying for the name on the sock than the sock itself.  If you find them on sale, I recommend these socks, otherwise, I suggest you fork over a few more dollars and go with Thorlos.","04 17, 2013",16867,236

After some testing, I settled on Wigwam Cool-Lite socks (grey, dark grey and white).  Medium fit my feet perfectly (Men 8.5E).

I bought brooks sneakers and my runners knee pain almost fully stopped immediately but I still had some issues with stiffness, discomfort and cracking in my knees. I was feeling like if I had extra arch support that would help. So I looked around and found these and since they help with pronation as well I decided to try them. They took some time to get used to. They have a harder shell under the arch and heel. I could feel them under my arches which surprised me as nothing is ever high enough to fill in all the negative space between my arch and the shoe. At first I wished it was softer because I was nervous my arches would get sore from the hard shell. I was pleasantly surprised that after the first use I had zero cracking or tension in my knees. I took them out for an hour because I was bothered by the arch support a bit and felt a little sore but almost immediately my knee started cracking again. So I put them back in and it stopped. By the end of the first day my arches had gotten used to the feeling and I was really happy and I have been using them everyday since. The combination of the brooks sneakers and the pinnacle breeze insoles have alleviated all of my runners knee symptoms. I have ordered a second pair to keep in my other shoes.

I had my massage therapist working on my legs and feet and we were trying to figure out what made my legs hurt so bad. She suggested finding some good shoe insoles that had good support.
First day, they fit right into my shoes and I didn't have to cut it down to make it fit. I started wearing them to work and left thinking I should have brought a spare pair of shoes in case my feet needed a break (the directions suggested only wearing them 3-4 hours to start with), but I only had the shoes on my feet for the day. I made it through the day and my feet actually felt better already!
Fast forward to now a week of wearing them almost everyday. My leg pain is much better. My knee pit where the muscle/tendon felt like it was pulled tight is gone, the heels and feet are much better as well!

By about month 4, there was a divot in the insole where the big toe of my right foot had apparently dug through the foam-like base. At the end of 5 months, the material at the top of the heel cup was separating as well.

I've since replaced these with some Superfeet greens which right out of the box seemed to be of higher quality construction (the bottom of the insole from the heel to arch was made of hardened material, whereas these were the same pliable material all the way through). I wouldn't NOT recommend these, but be aware they'll only last about a third of a year. If I remember, I'll try to update with the Superfeet's lifespan.","03 20, 2018",17337,715

Before buying these, i got the Dr. Scholls 440 at a retail store, at first they felt very comfortable and with good arc support, but just after 3 weeks of use the pain of being standing up for 40+ hours in a warehouse/office working environment came back, so those 40 dollars insoles did not work for me. I then decided to look for a different option, after some Google research and based on reviews at Amazon, keeping in mind that i was looking for a good arc support, i stripped it to 2 brands; Powerstep Pinnacle and Superfeet Black, initially i was slightly inclined to buy Superfeet even the price doubles Powerstep, but there was one review that cached my attention of a customer having the same issue as me, he tried before Dr. Scholls, then changing to Superfeet and he kept experiencing the same foot pain, i decided to give Powerstep a chance and i definitely made the right choice, no more pain.

That might have caused them to wear out quicker, still, I only got 3 months out of them. Even so, these are still the best yet.

Update: I ordered these again thinking maybe I got a defective pair the first time around. The answer is no. Still, right at the 3 month mark, they start to fall apart. The plastic on the heel moves and sticks up making it very painful.

I contacted powerstep to report the problem and was totally blown off. They told me that the company who sold them through Amazon was not an authorized reseller and refused to honor their guarantee. I wore them for 2 days and they are trash. Very unhappy with their customer service. I thought they might actually stand by their products, but I can see that they don't. They have lost a long time customer who works in surgery and has recommended them to many people who have foot issues. Well now that will change.

11825,4,A3V18QHG7NI2TG,B000KPIHQ4,"Purchased this item to replace worn inserts that came with a pair of athletic shoes.  Initial reaction was too much arch support, borderline uncomfortable, while at the same time noticing that having the extra arch support seems to be taking the weight off the outside of my foot relieving a noticeable amount of pain from a metatarsal fracture.  Adhering to the suggestion of following a break in period to allow for your foot to adjust I increased the amount of time I wore the shoes over few days before hitting the trail.  After a week or two I'm back up to a goal of 5-10 miles per day, and while I still notice the arch support for a brief period at the start of each hike it quickly fades into the background now that my focus is getting to the peak rather than allowing the foot pain to determine a turn around point.

Having had consistent foot pain for several weeks I made an appointment with a podiatrist who determined that as a result of my stride and bone structure I place a lot of weight on the outside of my foot which likely caused the stress fractures, walking around barefoot or flip flops when not hitting the trails or at the office is not at all conducive to a quick recovery.  Doctors advice, besides to stay off your feet, is to minimize walking barefoot, wear athletic shoes as much as possible for the cushion and support, invest in good dress shoes for work.  Learnings from mostly following his advise: proper footwear greatly accelerated the healing process and insoles could be a large part of the solution depending on your specific situation, and the insoles that come with shoes may not offer proper support, and will likely need to be replaced several times over life (miles not age) of your shoes.","11 9, 2017",4022,370

Now about the 3 star review. The only reason Im giving anything other than 5 stars is that the cloth cover on the insoles has either begun to peel off or peeled off completely. (See pic). Without the cloth cover its almost impossible to slide your feet into your shoes. Ive had to use spray glue to reattach the cloth and it only temporarily fixes it.

I wear a New Balance 12EEEE and they fit just right.

They are much more comfortable than the custom ones costing at least 10 times as much as the Powersteps.  The entire length of the insole is well-padded, providing a stable and exceedingly comfortable walking experience from the heel all the way through the instep area.  These are an excellent value and well worth purchasing if you have any of the foot conditions that normally can be relieved by the use of orthotic inserts.","08 8, 2017",15873,104

When I say slightly stiff, that is because some of those Dr. Sholls are too ""flimsy"" and they will move around a lot inside of your shoes. Like if you curl your toes in your shoes just to test it with a Dr Sholls brand, it curls with them. So you could imagine the sliding around while walking etc.

These have plenty of cushion for comfort, yet the bottom layer is stiff so they don' slide around. I wear these in my everyday work shoes and my feet feel great.","07 26, 2017",5414,810

12442,5,A3RFCCFPBZAS4A,B000KPIHQ4,"I have ordered these multiple times and use them to replace the insoles of all shoes where they will fit.  I have very miserable feet and I over pronate so these make my feet much less miserable and improve hip and back pain by correcting the pronation problem.  If possible, I remove the insoles from the shoes I purchase and add 2-3 Equate Comfort Cushion Insoles (similar to""Dr. Scholls Air Pillo""s)-whatever will fit without making the shoes too tight and then place these over the top.  If you have never worn something with a supportive arch, they may feel uncomfortable at first.  I started with original blue power steps and then moved up to Pinnacle and now I don't want to be without the Pinnacles, ever.  I have tried over 30 different brands of insoles and have a full bag and hundreds of wasted dollars on inserts that didn't help.  These are what work for me.  I can highly recommend Zappos for trying new things because they have a large selection and generous return policy and they pay shipping both ways.  Once you find what works, Amazon provides the affordable option for purchasing more.  I was always forced to buy very expensive athletic shoes that still were not comfortable without these inserts and additional padding, but recently tried the Pinnacles with 3 cushioned pads in some clearance men's shoes from Walmart and was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable they were and my adult son even complimented the look of the shoes.  The most expensive part of that combo is the inserts (they were more than the shoes and inserts combined).  But the best news is they might just expand your shoe options.  So if you suffer like I do, give them a try and if they don't work try other options until you find something that does.","07 18, 2017",2950,862

It was like having a new pair of shoes only I did not spend another $130 on new shoes. I have been wearing them daily for about 2 months and my feet still feel great.  The difference in these orthotics and less expensive ones in store is the deep heel cup which stabilizes the heel and the fairly rigid arch support. This may not be as comfortable to someone who does not have a flexible arch.
I also bought the 3/4 length for casual shoes and they also work great but do not take up as much room in the shoe. I ordered them for my children who are college students waiting tables for the summer and cannot wear tennis shoes  with good support to work. They love them too!

When you buy orthotic insoles, spend some money and get the best you can afford. They will wear out over time but the cheap ones wear out sooner.

Fun times.

The size Women's 9-9.5 fit into my Sketchers size 9 perfectly, with no extra room for sliding or pinching toes, and no bunching of the insole.

The front portion of the insole unfortunately is just like any average one which is why I gave it four stars not five. Note: the insole takes up quite a bit of room in your shoe so if your shoes are tight you may not be able to use them.

 Well my happiness was short-lived as I had to re-write my review. As you could see from the photograph  the arch support completely fell apart only after a few months of occasional wearing.

I read up on insoles and decided on these for a few reasons- The arch support is rigid vs foam or gel, which I felt would give insufficient support from looking at the various reviews, and secondly, the price point wasn't outrageous.

And I was right. The relief he got from these insoles was immediate. His pain went from an 8 to a 2. He's only been on them for about 4 days now, and the unbearable, relentless pain from the PF has been greatly reduced, even after he takes his shoes off after a full 9 hour work day. So they're working both for immediate relief, and for the more slow healing/correcting process for that tendon. Great product.","04 11, 2017",1164,77

The problem with my feet is that I have EDS hypermobility type (a connective tissue disorder) and the bones in my feet move around easily therefore causing lots of instability and an arch that disappears the moment I stand up.

In terms of arch support these are very good. In terms of offering stability - not so much. There's very little heel cup and they are exceptionally thin and have zero stiffness and no ball of foot cushioning.

Frankly, I have no idea why he recommended these to me given the nature of my foot problems.

12830,5,A5WGH4BZUXY0B,B000KPIHQ4,"Short:  These are a great insert for someone just dealing with Plantar Fascitis.  I like to jog/run 5-6 days a week (shorter 2-3 mile runs) and was getting quite depressed due to my inability to go very far without discomfort.  These have alleviated 90% of my discomfort and I am able to job near daily again and find that I can walk much longer in a day than before.  Highly Recommend.

Long:  I Bought these as I enjoy running/jogging and started to develop Plantar Fascititis.  Upon a lot of research I was originally directed to the green Superfeet insert but found that those did not help much (just do not fit into the arch well).  I originally was quite upset as I thought it was my feet and not a problem with the insert.  Before giving in and spending $800 at the Good Feet store for their inserts, I tried these on a recommendation from a friend.

I can say these inserts are exactly what I needed.  At first I thought they would at least be 'better' but I have found these to work very well and has allowed me to get back on my feet regularly again.  I enjoy my longer 3 mile jogs and can run more days in a row without resting than before.

If you are like me and tend to do a lot of research I'm guessing you too will be directed to the Superfeet product.  I would highly recommend trying these first at less than hald the cost (and only 5% of the cost of GoodFeet store inserts).","04 3, 2017",17178,598

12946,5,AXGF5FHWR52XK,B000KPIHQ4,"WOW!  Finally!

I've tried every insole on the market over the years.  I tried them when I was still able to be a CNC Machinist and Forewoman to try to save my Lower Back and ease my Plantar Fascilitis and now that I've had to quit my trade and go into Physical Therapy because of the aforementioned back getting much worse and going from ""really painful at a high-intensity, heavy-lifting job pain"" to ""I can't even walk upright or do anything but gentle stretches type-pain"".

I've begun Physical Therapy for my Lower Back & a Torn Rotater Ruff (yeah....terrible luck, I know) so I'm on my own for the PF because the Physical Therapist can only target so many areas at once.  I've been trying inserts for at least 10 years and they all caused my nearly instant and HORRIBLE pain and usually made my PF much worse.  Plus, they usually required cutting and trimming and didn't fit a variety of shoes to be truly versatile.

I bought these and kept all of the packaging because I fully expected to be sending them back.  Well...I threw out that packaging after my 1st week using these in my Running/Gym shoes as well as my casual shoes and some Snow Boots.  These have not just improved my Lower-Back Pain immensely....but my PF is 65% better (I'm also using PF Compression Socks, mind you and wearing those to bed to repair/heal).

What's amazing to me is that I'm also going to the Gym and doing 90-minute Cardio Sessions 6 days per week on top of the Physical Therapy to strengthen my whole body, lose the weight I've gained being unable to work/workout, and to build muscle near the areas that are injured.  So I'm wearing these things in my Running Shoes and wearing them for 90 minutes per day on Standing Ellipticals, Seated Ellipticals, Treadmills, and Leg Press Machines.  And there's NO PF pain throbbing afterward!  These are ROCK HARD insoles.  Please keep that in mind.  I think most people *myself included* fall for the ""gel insoles"" and ""memory foam comfort"" stuff thinking that will be better for our feet and PF (or back issues) because it seems like a cushioned sole would be best.  Now that I've tried these, I get why the others didn't work.  We need HARD Support.  If you can't tolerate hard insoles for some reason....these are not for you.  If you have lower back pain or PF and other insoles have failed you....you NEED to try these.

I purchased the Women's Size 8 - 8.5 and these fit my Running/Athletic shoes PERFECTLY.  Slipped them right in (after removing the original insoles, of course) and dared to go straight to the Gym and *hope* these would work out.  Well...they did!  Much better than my *expensive branded insole that came with said running shoe* and a notable difference in PF right away.

I didn't have to trim them at all and since they are so hard, you can easily slip them into and out of your shoes for a quick change.  I put them into my furry Uggs the next day and they fit just as well and kept the PF and lower back pain at bay.  I couldn't believe they were working.  I am so used to them feeling ""OK"" at first and then after a day or two causing a ""new"" pain or worsening old pain and having to throw away expensive insoles.  These are like a MIRACLE!  I haven't had a burning/shooting heel since I put these into my running shoes and considering my 6 days per week Gym Schedule and Physical Therapy is new to my body as well as HARD on my body....this seems amazing to me.

Don't stress about the sizing.  It's right on point.  Get whatever closely matches your normal shoe size because these are right on point.  They're also a bit wider (than I need because I have a very ""normal"" width foot) so if your foot is a little on the wider side, these have the extra space to fit them without making ""normals"" fit any lesser.  The arch is very high and hard and really supports you where you need it.  The contour and outside diameter is cut much more accurately than others and I think that's part of why no trimming is needed and if you buy your correct size....these should bit your current shoes like a glove.  I originally felt really stupid for spending this kind of money on *yet another* pair of insoles that are supposed to be ""so awesome"" ....but never worked for ME.  Now I can't wait to try some of their ""slimmer"" fits so that I can wear my evening shoes and other slimmer shoes without pain, as well.

The photos I'm posting show the running shoes I wear for Physical Therapy and the Gym with the original insole taken out in one shoe....and this insole placed inside of the other shoe.  The insole itself is laid next to the shoe for size and width comparison.  I also included a photo of the insole from the side-view to see the contour, and a photo of my bare foot (that's a compression sock) against just the insole to show how good the sizing is and how it fits a bare foot.

I highly recommend these - especially if you've tried every other brand and style and have decided *like me* that insoles just aren't ""for your problem"".  Because these ARE.  I really urge anyone with PF or Back Pain to give them a try! NO cons to this product.  Will buy again and again.","03 12, 2017",725,243

I have a high arch on my right foot which results in metatarsal pain after running.

If I leave the orthotic out, and just use the shoes insert I am running unevenly. I need a neutral insert to raise my left foot so that it is equal to the right foot with the orthotic. It would be nice if they sold these individually so that I could buy one for my right foot and another neutral insert for my left foot. Great for high arches, comfortable and fit like a glove.

Minus 1 star because I wish the arch was a little higher, but that's personal preference.
*Update*
I have now used these insoles for about 1.5 years. When I buy a pair of shoes, I throw away the insoles and use only these; so I have literally worn them every day for 1.5 years, and they are still going strong. I assume I'll have to purchase a new set in 6 months or so as I am seeing some signs of wear. Overall, I am very happy with these.

These though, dang!  When I put my foot in my boot with these I could tell that this was something special.  I need a little metatarsel support in the form of a bit of lifted arch support on the inner side of my food.  I have custom inserts but they never quite work with these boots.  These work in the way that I wish my $200 custom orthotics did with these boots.

The Pros cushioning made that shoe too snug.  I buy the Pros for walking, shopping etc.  I have always had foot problems and wore custom made orthotics for about 20 years but finally gave up on them.

However, they are a little bit thick and I did have a ton of pain from the multiple gigantic blisters that resulted from my feet rubbing against the tops of my shoes, an issue I have never had with the shoes I was wearing before. I don't think these are any thicker than most insoles, so it may be a bit unfair to dock a star for this, but I ended up pulling them out discreetly on a side street when I could barely walk from the blisters and tossed them in a garbage can.","11 15, 2016",13048,315

it takes a little getting used to at first.  it's a different feel, and there is a bit of sliding, so for active sports, you may notice more of a difference, and they may not be best for that.  but for everyday use, it just takes a day or two to get used to them.  also, in those first 2 days, i would only wear them for about half the day, because the arch of your foot my get a little sore being at a new angle.","09 9, 2016",4912,789

13671,5,AVE93C3GPMTN2,B000KPIHQ4,"2 second review:
These are great inserts that are comfortable and provide great arch support. Get them!

In Depth review:
I suffer from some foot problems. Suffer is a strong word but pretty accurate. Details are here, or just jump to the next paragraph because you probably don't actually care about my feet.
I have flat feet with barely any arch in them. I also have bunions which make my toes angle about 15 degrees inward (and judging by my father they will be at 45 degrees in the next 15 years). My flat feet creates adduction (rotating inward) in my step, worsening the bunion issue and increasing the tension in my feet. In any case, all these things make my feet hurt frequently. Not necessarily every day, and not necessarily ""pain"" where it is sharp an unbearable. Think what sore muscles feel like, as a deep inside dull pain - sometimes throbbing - and just constantly there. That is as close as I can describe it. So anyways - that is my situation.
I have always looked at arch supports and cushioning to attempt to help with my situation. I have never been happy with any of the products or results. So I basically stopped looking figuring nothing off the shelf would ever help. My mom went to a podiatrist for some of her issues and she got inserts that cost $400 and even then she wasn't happy with them. I pretty much just gave up and accepted my lot in life.

An extended family member mentioned she wore these and loved them, just in a passing comment, so I looked them up and decided to give them a try. Honestly, I bought a pair for my wife first since she works on her feet. When they arrived I looked at them and stood on them (without shoes) just to get an idea on what they are like. They seemed good, and my wife confirmed she liked them so I pulled the trigger and bought myself a pair.

I have worn these for about a week now and love them. Are they the best thing out there? Probably not. Are they the solution for everybody? Probably not. But I do think they are probably the best over the counter item that you can buy and will probably help 90% of the people out there. All for a reasonable price.

Support -
These supports add a good amount of support, and hold my feet in a position that doesn't allow them to move in a way that will hurt my feet or ankles. They are very comfortable, and my lower back pain is lessened from the improved step.
I would probably comment that I do feel them pressing on my arches, since I am flat footed. This can be uncomfortable after a while, but not worse than the typical foot pain I have without them, so the benefits far outweigh this issue. I would suspect if my arches were slightly higher (or the supports slightly lower) I wouldn't feel this at all.

Sizing -
I bought the Men's 10-10.5 sizing. I wear 10 or 10.5 depending on the cut of the shoe.
Ironically, I just bought a paid of 11s just because the cut tapered in at the tip (which isn't good for my bunions) but in the 11 it fit well around my toes and the extra space in front doesn't alter my standing or stepping.
The Pinnacles fit the size 11 shoes exactly.comparing the removed insoles to the Pinnacle they were a dead on match in size.
That surprised me since I wouldn't have imagined that much extra material would be used, but at the end of the day it is a good thing, because they are pretty much guaranteed to fit your shoes - but also very likely you will need to trim them to fit.
I will also comment that with the full length insert they recommend you remove the shoes existing insert first. This is a must as otherwise the shoe is too tight and cramped and just trades one problem for another. But actually replacing the insole is like converting your shoe into something new and better.

I don't switch between shoes very often, but I can definitely see me buying a couple pairs of these and cutting them to fit ever shoe I own.
It is well worth the investment.","09 6, 2016",4916,938

The main problem is that the arch is too high and very uncomfortable for me. Same thing with Powerstep original. I believe I have low arches and only need a little support.

Superfeet blue and black were also too high, and too hard feeling.

If Powerstep made a ""low arch"" version that was only HALF the arch height of the original or Pinnacle that might work. I need to return them.","09 4, 2016",3611,319

I've put them in my Justin work boots and walking shoes. I have a 4-E width and though these inserts don't cover my whole foot, they do the job. I sure wish they were more sturdy.

Although these aren't going to make up for an 8 hr shift on your feet and make them feel pedicure-fresh, they helped immensely. I feel less fatigue and it gives me the support in my high arch that i needed. The only critique i can give is that i would like the toe area could be a little more gel textured if possible.

I have flat feet and over pronate, much more on the right than the left.

I've been stumbling along until very recently,  when I decided to try non-prescription inserts. Amazon offered free returns so figured I had nothing to lose.

13783,4,A1JQHYC4Y8VMGO,B000KPIHQ4,"After searching for the perfect Dr Scholl's inserts for more running shoes (when the original inside wore through), I decided to settle on a  pair designated for work shoes. I then read reviews on multiple sites and realized they were probably not even worth the $7 I was about to pay for them with a coupon. I found information about most recommended ""over the counter"" inserts for shoes and determined Powerstep was one of the most recommended and used. Since I needed to replace the actual shoe insert, I needed a full length quality insole and decided to try the Original Powerstep; however, after reading reviews on Amazon and talked to someone directly with Powerstep, I chose to try the more supportive and cushioned Pinnacle for about the same price as the Original. I am very pleased with my choice. Since my shoes are quite stretched out, these fit with plenty of room to move my toes around. I removed my old, torn up insert and placed in the size 9-9.5 insoles in my size 9 shoe. It fit perfectly, without any need to trim/cut, and even had more room. I switched to a more cushioned sock and it is great with plenty of room still, but not so much that my shoe feels like it would slip off. Make sure to get the size appropriate for the shoe, not your foot size. I usually wear size 8.5 in shoes, except for athletic shoes I wear a size 9 and was concerned the insole would be too big and not line up with arches okay. Well my reservations were unnecessary thank goodness. The heel is cradled perfectly with this premium insole. The arch support is the best part of the whole insole and makes me smile wearing my shoes since it is so supportive of my feet. This is much better than any insole I have tried and I really hope they last a long time. What's great is also being able to easily move them from shoe to shoe. If these outlive my athletic shoes, I truly believe they will extend the life of any future pairs, wearing the bottoms down at a much slower pace. I would definitely recommend the Pinnacle Powerstep insole for lots of cushioned support, unless you need something ultra slim throughout and in that case, try the Original Powerstep for sure. My only complaint was I was hoping to get more cushion and support at the ball of my foot, which is pretty thin, but still helpful. I have considered looking for the ball of foot cushions made by Powerstep and adding it on top, but have not decided yet. Everything arrived in tact, well packed and secure. With Prime shipping, it arrived in a little over a day. The insoles are in official packaging from Powerstep like they were pulled right off a rack and include a guide to all the different types of Powerstep insoles. I may update my review in a few months, after determining how fast they are wearing down and a projected last-ability. One last note: Some people mentioned how the insoles needed to be eased into, by only wearing a couple of hours at a time. This may vary from person to person, based on your feet, foot issues you are trying to fix, the type of shoe you are placing the insoles inside of, and the type of movement (running, walking, etc) you are making while wearing these. For me personally, I needed no time to ease into the feel of the insoles and had no foot fatigued or discomfort of any time initially, or after wearing nearly every day for a week so far. I hope everyone else has as good of luck as me and to Powerstep: Please add a tiny bit more ball of foot cushion to the Pinnacle!","07 27, 2016",7198,397

I had a pair of better inserts from the foot Dr. , but can't afford those every 6 months. So I am giving yours a try.  So far
I've been happy with them.  Next time I'd like to order a pair that's a little stiffer maybe. Otherwise it's THUMBS UP from me.

13787,5,A1WP7RI1ZW934Z,B000KPIHQ4,"Completely honest review.  I have plantar fasciitis.  I am overweight with tiny feet(size 5.5 in womens).  I work retail so I have to be on my feet for hours in a day, at least 40 hours a week.  Upon developing plantar fasciitis, I found that even the slightest amount of walking, I had to take copious amounts of pain pills.  This went on for a while, until I began getting very concerned with the amount of aleve, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen I was consuming.  After days of research, I finally decided to invest in Asics Gel Kayano 19s and purchase these Powerstep Pinnacle inserts.  Day one, my feet still hurt, but not as much.  I didn't find myself coming home and walking like a 120 year old man.  These inserts have saved me.  They have saved my job, they have saved my sanity, and they have helped me reach a healthier weight because I can finally move again!  Not only do I buy them at least once a year(as I'm on my feet so often), I have purchased them for others who have told me about their foot pain so they could try them.  These people have been just as amazed as I was, something so small can make such a huge difference in one's quality of life.  I will never go without these inserts!","07 26, 2016",11760,459

I learned to sand away most of it, and cushion it, but it kept feeling irritated as I walked, and trying to grow back. If I had flat feet, maybe my insoles didn't lift them enough.

I run about 3 days a week or a total of about 18 miles.  I buy new running shoes about once a year, however others may prefer to buy shoes more often in this mileage category.  When replacing my running shoes I look into the need to replace the orthotics as well but only do so if I don't like the way they are wearing.  I have gotten more than 1 shoe change out of them (1 year) but you need to be careful to inspect them at least annually due to the fact that once they decide to give out (usually in the arch where the seam of hard plastic meets the softer front piece) they go fast.  I missed a small crack in the area outlined and about 4 miles into an 8 mile run the hard plastic broke through the soft padding and caused a nasty blister on my arch that took a long time to heal.","06 15, 2016",803,185

They fit as expected in every shoe I've tried (the same size fits in all of my shoes) and I can be on my feet in desert boots for 8 hours at a time without worry. If your shoes don't have built in support, you've got to get Powerstep insoles! The price sounds a little steep at first, but they hold up great. I've been wearing the first set for over a year with barely any signs of wear. They're still just as comfortable and are holding together well. There's nothing negative to say about these insoles -- I wish I had started wearing them earlier and I think everyone would benefit from having them in almost any shoe.

Also, if the shoe feels very tight against the top of your foot after putting in the insole, don't worry. It'll take a little time for the shoe to stretch out to accommodate, but every pair of shoes has. Don't worry that your shoes will be uncomfortable forever. It probably takes about a day or so to get stretched out and then they'll be fine from then on.","06 15, 2016",3475,926

The heal of my left foot started to become sore again so I decided to replace my Powerstep insoles because they were old.  I thought this pair would be great because there was extra padding.  Long story short; Plantar Fasciitis back in both feet & tore the Plantar Fascia in right foot due to the added cushion.  II wish that I would have replaced them with the same exact Powerstep without padding.  I've been on a leave of absence from work & I have been in PT for over a month.  I switched inserts to Superfeet with maximum heal support & Plantar Fasciitis is slowly getting better.  I do like Powerstep, but this particular one caused a lot of problems for me.

These were okay, although they definitely have more lift than I personally wanted, they gave me a slight pain in my arch that went away after a short time wearing them. One surprise side-effect that I originally attributed to my shoes was the pain on the top of my foot that I had while wearing these.  It seemed I couldn't tie my shoe loosely enough for my foot to not hurt unless it felt like it was about to fall off. After I replaced these I realized my shoes were not to blame, but these orthodics were.  However, what really drove me to replace them was the fact that I managed to wear a hole through them underneath the ball of my foot within 2-3 months of getting them.  My old footbeds lasted for years (embarrassing as it should probably be that I used them that long) and when they did start to wear out I didn't even realize at first because it didn't really affect the performance much, when these went it was very obvious when I wore them and slightly uncomfortable.

The foam that is supposed to provide all this great support started to break off near the front of my left foot insert near the toes. Horrible quality and build! I wouldn't even pay $5 for this useless product. And in case you are wondering, I walk only....no running! That's right, they can't even handle a few weeks of walking without breaking!

These inserts work surprisingly well once you've gotten accustomed to having the extra support they provide. The package directions recommend using the inserts for a few hours to start, gradually progressing to all day wear. This is good advice. It's also advisable to remove any insoles in your shoes before putting in the orthotics.  Otherwise, the shoes are likely to be too tight in the instep.

It has been over a week of use now (10-12 hrs a day with boots on), and I can say that I am substantially happier with the super feet green insoles.  The thing I notice is that the pinnacles have substantial arch support - I would venture to say too much for me, as soon as I put on my boots I can tell the difference from my other pair.  While they seem to be of good quality, and are made in the USA - when my feet feel like tenderized hamburger at the end of the day, I can't continue using them.

14433,4,A1A006227X28SA,B000KPIHQ4,"This is a very good alternative to custom-made orthotics. I bought these on the recommendation of my podiatrist when I asked about having a new pair of orthotics made that were more flexible than the semi-rigid custom pair that I have worn for 10+ years. I am a runner, and the custom pair that I have are not quite flexible enough to allow my foot full range of motion. The Powerstep insoles are the perfect solution to my problem. They are covered with a plush foam material that over time conform to the shape of your foot, thus making the built-in arch support essentially the same as a custom-made insole but for a fraction of the price. At first, the left insole felt like the arch support section was a little too high--I could feel it pressing into my arch instead of supporting it--but after about two weeks of daily wear the foam covering had compressed enough that it no longer felt weird. It was never painful, just slightly weird feeling (this is likely due to the shape of my own feet and not something everyone will experience).

The only cons I can think of are that these tend to be a bit wide, so per the instructions I had to use a pair of scissors to trim the foam covering to where it properly fit in my shoes without having to fight to get them in there. They also seem to wear out quicker than custom insoles, so you will probably have to replace these about once a year, possibly more if these get heavy wear. If you're a runner, I recommend getting one pair for your running shoes and a second pair for your everyday work/leisure shoes.","09 15, 2015",5396,217

As he promised, in a couple of weeks, the pain was much less severe and finally after a couple of months the pain was gone.  I replaced the factory insoles in my shoes with these. With daily wear they last a little over a year before the heel portion starts to break down.  But if you have heel pain or plantar faciaitis pain, I highly recommend you replace the insoles in your daily shoes with these arch supports.  For $35 a pair or so, it's money well spent.

14525,4,A1DXBB13KCWHMV,B000KPIHQ4,"I really wanted to write an in depth helpful review so that I could actually try and help people find some relief for their foot, back, and knee pain that they might be experiencing like I do. Before I start, let me say that from my research and testing of many different OTC orthotic insoles and arch supports I do not think they are all bad or all good. I think they have to be matched to the type of foot you have. Having said that, it can be frustrating to continuously spend money on insoles that offer no help. I have not tried everything on the market, but I have tried many and here are the results that have helped me.
  First, I have a size 10 foot that is wide. My foot actually measures 9.5 and E in width on a brannock device but through experience I always buy a 10 2E running shoe. Even then certain styles might be a bit snug in the width for me. I am 5'11"" and weigh 194. So over the years from gaining weight, being on my feet all day in the medical field, and being pretty active, my arches have fallen. Until I found out they had fallen, I never understood why after being on my feet all day the pain in my feet, ankles, and knees, was downright terrible. Then I started trying the different inserts and some helped but most were a waste of money. You can research on the net how fallen arches contribute to this pain.
  For my condition, I tend to need a higher arch support that will not collapse when running and staying on my feet all day. So began my search.
For my type of condition, the two best products that have worked for me are the blue colored powerstep pinnacle and the Dr. Scholls # 430 insert sold on the foot mapping machines at walmart. I do realize that these are not custom inserts, but I am trying to avoid the expensive orthopedist route as long as I can.
  So the powerstep pinnacle has the right amount of the medium to high arch support that I require. I can feel the lump under my arch as some have complained about, but this seems to be exactly what I need to feel relatively pain free after being on my feet all day or running my miles each evening. These do take a day or so to get used to, but they have helped me very well for the most part. Do I feel like I'm 18 and problem free again....no, but its the best I've felt yet short of spending a fortune and going the custom route. I have worn these insoles two ways. On shoes that run big I have placed them on top of the factory insole which gave just a little extra cushion and I have also removed the factory insole and used just the powerstep insole by itself. These are strictly running shoes that I have tested these in, but I have no doubt they would work in boots as well. I do not think they would fit in dress shoes. As a side note I also tried the maroon colored pinnacle max but the wedge on the bottom of the orthotic over compensated too much for my level of pronation and it was uncomfortable for me. I use the blue inserts in a stability type running shoe and this has been the best combination for me.
  The other insert that worked well for me was the 430 Dr. Scholls on top of the factory insole as these are 3/4 length.
So for my type of foot, I have tried the green super feet which did not offer enough arch support but were very comfortable for someone who may require less support. The pinnacle maxx were great except for that square plate underneath which over corrected my pronation and was uncomfortable. I tried the Dr. Scholls arch pain relief which were terrible compared to the other 430's. They did not fit well in any shoe and the arch support while high, did not ever seem to fall in the right position for my foot. I tried the envelop 3/4 orthotics and these did not work well either. They too just never fit in the shoe right or felt natural. I tried the VIVEsole 3/4 length and these felt like they had no arch support at all and were so narrow they kept shifting around in the shoe.
  I am still waiting to receive some spenco's and some prolab p3 semi customs to try and see how they do.
I will rate the pinnacles at a 4 because they feel about as good as my #430 Dr. Scholls and they do help a lot, but I'm sure compared to a custom they can only do so much. They were by far the best OTC I have come across in my testing so far. So if you need the higher support from fallen arches like I do, these may help you. Remember, you will feel the highness under your arch which you get used to. and you should wear them intermittently the first few days to adapt to them. Don't be afraid to try them with or without the factory insole left in place.

********update********* I now had a chance to compare the blue pinnacles against my expensive semi-custom prolab p3 orthotics and I am sending the P3's back. It's not that they were bad, they just were not as comfortable as the blue pinnacle orthotics and the pinnacles are 1/3 the price!!!! I am considering changing this review to 5 stars because of how pleased I am with the pinnacles compared to all of the other orthotics I am slowly trying. I do still think they might be a bit tough for constant running compared to the #430's because the 430's have so much cushion.","07 18, 2015",18366,369

I would not be without them!!!!,"05 21, 2015",11838,598
14616,4,A1P6QTCSTHELP4,B000KPIHQ4,"As someone who needed extra arch support in my shoes, I'd like to really thank the other customers/reviewers here, because it was based on your many positive reviews that I decided to try the Powerstep Pinnacle Insoles after having tried many other brands with very limited success. Hands down, these are the most comfortable, effective insoles I've ever worn in my shoes. When I wear them, it's like I never had any problem with plantar fasciatis. The pain is gone, the sore legs and feet are gone. Just normal walking and even exercising without discomfort. As a result, I'm going to be buying additional pairs so I can add them to my other shoes without having to change the insoles every time I change my shoes.

The only reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is I'm a tall guy (6 ft 8 ins) with a size 15-16 foot. And Pinnacle's largest size is rated at only 14.5 for men, meaning they come up short in my shoes. But no problem, I traced the outline of my shoes' regular insole and then cut out a matching add-on piece from an old pair of Spenco flat insoles to attach to the Pinnacle insole in the toes area so I don't get any friction/rubbing there. So please Pinnacle, how about making a size 15-16 version of your insoles???

I should also say, I'm writing this review after having worn the Pinnacle insoles constantly in my shoes for more than a month since my purchase, including a lot of daily exercise walking. So if any comfort or durability issues were going to arise, they would have arisen by now. None have. Much to my chagrin, before Pinnacle, I spent close to $200 on a pair of custom-made podiatrist designed insoles that never really felt comfortable on my feet or alleviated my discomfort. I've also got a drawerful of other store-bought insoles that helped a little to varying extents, but still ultimately left my feet and legs and back sore and uncomfortable.

At least for me and my feet, the Powerstep Pinnacle Insoles really did the job. They're thin enough that I can wear them comfortably in most of my styles of shoes. They're not thick and spongy like some of the New Balance arch support insoles. And it seems to me that the Pinnacles have a firmer (higher?) and more supportive arch area than the Spenco Total Support insoles that I bought and tried at the same time as the Pinnacles. So once again, thanks to everyone here who finally pointed me in the direction of a real solution to my plantar woes.","05 21, 2015",5378,796

Sometimes it's tight shoes that cause corns and bunions, but sometimes it's shoes that are too loose that allow your feet to move back and forth; both scenarios cause friction and can harm your tootsies. That being said, these are not going to work for me because they eat up too much of the depth of the boot so that all of my toes are tight against the top of the boot. I did try to cut them down bit into a more 3/4 length, and they feel better, but I think in the end the heel cup is too wide for my narrow heel cup; I have several other custom made units that do have a narrow heel cup but don't always work either. they work in my slippers so maybe that's where they will be used.

I have tried quite a few other products, even ""cutom"" orthopedic made"" insoles which never quite fit correctly, and were never comfortable or as soft feeling as these.

I was reading the reviews of these and insoles that cost twice as much and decided to start with the less expensive of the few. The first week or so was not much difference to me, but the pain was noticeably less. The insoles were a bit weird feeling at first. But here I am a week later and am VERY happy to report my heel pain and arch pain is literally completely gone. I want to wear my work steel toes everywhere now as they seriously feel that much more comfortable.

14792,4,A3VTTK9AU548NZ,B000KPIHQ4,"I have tried many insoles and shoe accessories and I have settled on these.  Some of the insole and accessories I have tried:

- Powerstep Pinnacle burgundy insoles
- The Walking Company's leather insoles
- ProFit heel cups
- Scholls gel insoles
- Scholls gel arch support
- WalkFit arch supports
- New Balance insoles
- SuperFeet Merino insoles
- Etc.

YMMV.  The Powerstep blue (not the burgundy which I found too hard) is a nice all-around solution.  I do not think it would fix PF on its own but it helps in conjunction with a night splint.

I use the WalkFits in my slippers as they slide around in my regular shoes and the Powerstep Blue are fullsized and more comfortable for walking.  The WalkFits are rigid and hard (and inexpensive) arch supports and they feel very supportive.

The Powersteps are thick and need shoes with enough volume (and usually a removable insole) to work.  I do have a pair of boots that are roomy enough to take these (barely) on top of the existing insole.

For PF I find the Powerstep in most shoes, a thick arch support in shoes that cannot fit the Powerstep and a night splint to keep things working properly.

Night splint available on Amazon: Active Ankle Dns Dorsal Night Splint.","12 21, 2014",8345,935

Very good support -  overall its stiff not floppy, with a gel pad for the heel.  But its a bit  too much for good athletic shoes which already have decent arch support.

Not as ""cushy"" as others I've tried . like Dr Scholls gels for heel pain, but those aren't designed for arch support, so I still use them in sneakers.

14856,5,A318TWMKSNF2P1,B000KPIHQ4,"I've been using custom orthotics for 20 years.  I have tried many off the shelf orthotics during that time.  All of the off the shelf orthotics and about half the custom orthotics ended up in a bin which I labeled the orthotics graveyard.  None of the off the shelf orthotics worked well for my plantar fasciitis and damaged knee.  The custom orthotics that didn't end up in the graveyard worked ok but were never very comfortable.  Usually too hard with high points that irritated my arch.  These Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotic Inserts are amazing.  They are exceptionally soft and comfortable while providing very good support for my arch.  They work very well for both plantar fasciitis as well as bad knees.  I absolutely love these things!  I'm so glad I found them.

As far as sizing, I wear a 9 1/2 shoe and find that the 10-10 1/2 orthotic positions the arch more effectively and fit the shoe better than the 9-9 1/2.

Bottom line - You'll love these things.  Very comfortable; Much less expensive than custom orthotics; The only pair of off the shelf orthotics that works so well.  These things are wonderful.  Try them.  You won't be disappointed.","10 26, 2014",5396,217

They are a cheaper alternative to custom orthotics.

The inserts are very sturdy.  There's a polymer insert between the cushions to make it stiff and after using them for a few days, your feet will conform to it and the inserts gets a little softer (my opinion).  It takes a few days to get used to them depending on how bad your arches are.  I would recommended them, however, make sure you consult with your doctor first.

Price:  3/5  stars

Any hard soled and form fitting insert ought to have the same pain relieving effect. I have owned this pair for over a year now and they seem to be almost in the same condition as when I first purchased them. But this insert alone probably won't be enough to fully relieve your heel pain (if that is your problem). My suggestion is to also purchase a night splint. If you can adjust to sleeping with it at night you might find the combination of splint and insert life changing.

The insert and night splint combo has allowed me to stay on my feet all day but I still cannot go jogging or even walk for an hour at a time without eventually suffering the consequences. However, I can hold down a full time job on my feet in sales and this has made a huge difference, especially avoiding costly surgery.

Another problem I have with the Pinnacle Insert is that it provides arch support for pronation control (rolling inward, as those with fallen arches often will), but it doesn't support the lateral side of the foot.

They are firm, with strong arch support and no thick padding under the heal. I find padded insoles are a gimmick and elevating the heal makes shoes no longer fit right. The surface is a low friction cloth. The frame is rigid as it should be, and not foam.

I have pronation and weak arches. These go into my Red Wings, Fryes, Sketchers, Blundstones, dress shoes, Asics.  They are intended for runners but work great in all my shoes.

I had suffered with plantar fasciitis (pain at the front of your heel, on the bottom of your foot) for a couple years, and had difficulty walking at times, and certainly could not run.  Some custom-made orthotics (over $100) helped a little, but after about 5 months of trying them I was ready to give up.  I was on the site heelspurs.com and wanted to see what most recommended.  Powerstep Pinnacles got the most votes so I tried them.  After one day my pain was at 50%.  Within a week it was almost gone.  After a month I was healed.  It was really a miracle.

If you have heel spurs or plantar fasciitis, at least give these a try.  Worked better than all the stretches, icing, dorsiflexion boots, and other orthotics.

The only downside is that some shoes that are a bit shallow have trouble, since these are slightly thick, your heel can slip out of the shoe in some cases.

These help out people with flat feet or over-pronators.  If you have trouble with ankle or knee pain, these can help.  Heel, arch, ankle, knee.  Try these out and you will see.  These have changed my life.","11 18, 2013",974,904

I then received prescription insoles after have my feet measured and molded.  Luckily my insurance paid for the insoles as they were about 450$.

15172,5,ACSB3PHA1LY0J,B000KPIHQ4,"Over time I have tried multiple brands of inserts to help alleviate pain from Plantar Fasciitis and until I used these none worked or at best only worked slightly.  These seem to work very well.

Basically I am well overweight and have a lot of foot aches from carrying that extra weight around.  As I have aged it of course has gotten worse.  The plastic inside of these is very, very stiff.  It definitely supports the arches or lack thereof and yet the cushion has enough give to make it comfortable.  The fit of the insoles into your shoes is very good if you order the correct size based on your shoe size.

I will tell you though that you will need to do the following:

Remove the insoles from your shoes. The Powerstep Pinnacles really need that room or your shoes will be too tight, uncomfortable, and more than any other reason you will not be able to lace them properly to hold your foot in a correct and secure position.

You will also need to carry shoes with you for a few days that do not have these inside them because your feet will be very tender for a couple of days while trying to get used to the correct positioning.  I suggest breaking your feet into them over the course of a week or so, adding an additional hour of wearing time each day.

As another tip...to those of you that wear wide shoes....I wear a 9 EE normally.  But when I buy things like cowboy boots, many times I buy them in 10 or 1.5 E or EE depending on their cut.  Always order your Powerstep Pinnacles to fit your true foot size not the size of an oversized shoe.  The reason for this is that the actual arch support will be in the correct position for your foot. If you have to deal with this, you may have to put a small spot of glue at the toe of the Powerstep so that it remains in the proper place.","09 26, 2013",16684,457

We've purchased the nighttime boot, the supports that can be worn barefoot/sandals, all sorts of muscle ointments - you name it.

Several foot doctors and their patients are the ones who recommended to us this particular brand.

15303,3,A18FHN51URF5VP,B000KPIHQ4,"An ex-football player past his prime (6'3"", 360 lbs, size 13D, medium arch), I was recently diagnosed with plantar fasciitis. My orthopedist recommended daily stretching exercises and Orthoheel slippers to wear indoors (no more walking around in socks). What a difference! The slippers and exercises lessened my symptoms from the start and, over time, eliminated most of my discomfort, so I decided to find some orthotic inserts to improve my street shoes.

So far, I've tested:
1. Dr. Scholl's Massaging Gel Extra Support
2. Aetrex Copper Medium Arch
3. Spenco Polysorb Total Support
4. Superfeet Copper DMP
5. Powerstep Pinnacle
6. Powerstep Pinnacle Pro

each for two hours' total walking time over a few days in two pairs of my favorite shoes: New Balance 606 hikers and Cole Haan loafers with Nike Air.

Dr. Scholl's Massaging Gel Extra Support: Advertised for big & tall men, they didn't do much for me. While the extra cushioning helped at first, it helped less and less the longer I walked on them. I mentioned this to my orthopod and he told me the key to managing PF is not cushioning, it's support. Grade: D

Spenco Polysorb Total Support: Remembering my doc's advice, I chose these for the rigid heel cup and arch support. Though quite comfortable overall, the arch support was a bit too low for my medium-high arches and the heel cup was insufficient support for weight. While they worked reasonably well for me, I believe they would a be better choice for lighter individuals with lower arches. Grade: B

Aetrex Copper Medium Arch: Promising better arch support, these felt very similar to the Spenco insoles even after walking around the block. I then swapped one of the Aetrex insoles for one of the Spenco insoles and walked around again. Only then could I tell them apart. The Spenco offered a little better support for the mid- and fore-parts of my foot, the Aetrex offered a little better support for my arch. Grade: B

Superfeet: I was in an Allen Edmonds store and noticed the Superfeet insoles. The clerk said many men my size have good success with them. I tried the Orange and the Copper DMP versions in the store. Finding the Orange too high for my arches, I got a pair of the Copper DMP. These are easily the most rigid of the insoles I've tried...and easily the best. Superfeet arch support sits farther back on the insole than other brands. This made a real difference in the support and comfort I felt walking long distances. I also found the medial post support in the heel did a better job than other insoles in combatting over-pronation. Grade: A [Update: I have since tried Superfeet Black in dress shoes that couldn't accommodate the Orange insole. They work well but are not as supportive as the Copper.]

Powerstep Pinnacle: While it seems well-made and offered good support, it simply did not work for me. The gel-based arch support sits too far forward and in the middle of the insole. The insoles felt like I had lumps of clay underfoot. After a few blocks of brisk walking, my feet began to fatigue as if I were walking barefoot in sand. Again, these may work for some people but they didn't for me. Grade: C

Powerstep Pinnacle Pro: Other wearers commented that the Pinnacle Pro differs markedly from the Pinnacle, so I tried a pair. I barely made it a block before heading back home. Though more rigid than the Pinnacle and with a better heel cup, the Pinnacle Pro was too inflexible through the arch and ball of my foot. These were the only insoles I tried that truly caused me pain. Of course, it could just be the contours of my feet, and for others the Pinnacle Pro might be great. Grade: F","02 28, 2013",6446,663
15304,4,A1U8RVAMBFL6DP,B000KPIHQ4,"these are different than most because they are fairly rigid, where most supports you can fold in half, but not these. They are still comfortable yet stronger than most you can find in the stores. I feel they are as good as the $250 they are trying to sell at these fancy foot stores, for only $30 or less. The foot stores act like they are scientifically looking at your feet and then they say stand on one of 3 models and tell me which feels the best. I don't need a person to tell me figure out for myself if they feel alright or not and then try and charge me $250-$500 for a non custom orthotic. These are more expensive than the ones you'll find in Meijer, etc. but much better built and much cheaper than the so-called foot stores.","02 27, 2013",9891,511

I did end up buying the Birkenstock blue insoles to wear with my dressier shoes, as they fit a little better in smaller shoes.

15378,5,A15C8UV9YVDU9I,B000KPIHQ4,"Like many other consumers here, I suffer from flat feet and was about to get some orthopedic inserts, which can cost hundreds of dollars.  Before going to my foot specialist, I decided to look on amazon.com and see if there were any over the counter inserts that could do the job.  I figured if they worked, i would save myself hundreds of dollars.  If not, I figured I was only out 20-30 bucks or so.  I saw the reviews for these and decided to buy.

I'm 6'0, overweight, and am in my late 30s.  I am trying to lose weight and have been exercising for about a year now.  Although my weight is dropping, I wanted to incorporate running into my regimen (in addition to the spinning classes) to lose weight quicker.  I haven't run since I was in my early 20s.  Since then, I've found it increasingly painful to run with flat feet.  My shins, arches, get so painful, even after running a few minutes, that I had to stop even though I could have gone on for a while despite that.  Additionally, even during the normal workday, or when traveling and running around airports, I found that my flat feet were giving me problems, even when buying expensive shoes, e.g. Ecco shoes, etc.

I got these and had some minor discomfort during the first few days.  I imagine it's just from the initial getting used to the inserts.  I've been wearing them now for about 2 months and the pain has gone away.  These inserts have been incredibly effective.  I realized just how effective when last week, during a ""boot camp"" type class, we had to sprint at various points in the hour.  Initially I started feeling the tell-tale pain in my shin and arches, but soon the pain disappeared.  I was really amazed that I could run, and run and run without pain!  I haven't run pain free for many years.  This was the high point of the past couple of months.  The persistent back pain that would appear after being on my feet at the airport all day, or in the office all day, has gone.  I am really amazed.  I was so amazed that I told my father about these as well.  He has flat feet and is a runner.  He's not overweight but still ahd many of the same pains I had in the shins and arches.  Since wearing these, his pain has also gone.  GET THESE before you guy ortho inserts!  They work!","10 8, 2012",1340,376
15379,5,A2GMP8YLR46XDY,B000KPIHQ4,"Great product that was recommended by the podiatrist for overpronation. Insurance would not cover orthotics, so this was an alternative.","10 6, 2012",13695,409
15380,4,A3BBJM5OFNAXJ3,B000KPIHQ4,"After reading about Plantar Fasciitis on the internet, I decided I needed to get some type of orthotic device for my shoes.  I bought 3 products to try out: ProFoot Plantar Fasciitis Men's Orthotic Insert, the Dr. Scholl's PRO for Arch Pain Relief inserts, and the Powerstep Pinnacle Insole.

Out of the three, the ProFoot helped the least.  To provide really good arch support, the arch part of the orthotic needs to be quite firm.  The arch area on the ProFoot is just some type of foam rubber and in my opinion doesn't provide much support at all.  It's just too soft and not thick enough.  If you have a pair of shoes that only need a slight amount more of arch support, then perhaps these would work for you, but if you are suffering from plantar fasciitis (like I am), I think more suitable products are out there (that cost more money, of course).

The Dr. Scholl's that I mentioned before are OK, but not perfect.  I have a pair of tennis shoes that will not accommodate a full length orthotic, so I like it because it doesn't go all the way to the toe.  I needed a little more arch support in those tennis shoes, and the Dr. Scholl's worked better for me than this ProFoot model.

Lastly, the Powerstep Pinnacle Insole was the most expensive of the 3 (around $23) but it provided the most arch support (perhaps even a bit too much if the shoes already have decent arch support built in).  On the Powerstep arch supports, the arch area is reinforced with hard plastic which keeps it shaped correctly.

I had plantar fasciitis for several months, and using the Powerstep supports in a pair of New Balance tennis shoes (they don't have a whole lot of arch support built in), the pain has nearly gone away in about 3 weeks.  Keep in mind that besides wearing arch supports, I also modified the way I do step aerobics at the gym.  I was on my toes way too much, and now I understand why the instructors say to let your heel go all the way to the ground every time, instead of being on your toes all the time.  Also I controlled the force of my foot coming down.","09 29, 2012",8026,387

I finally found a pair of New Balance shoes that allowed me to work out for over 30 minutes before discomfort set in, but wanted to go longer so decided to try OTC orthotics as the last step before custom ones.

I am so glad I tried these! These orthotics were the last ingredient to relieving my foot pain for the full hour it took to work out!!!  LOVED 'EM!

As they're won't to do, my beloved shoes finally wore out, the next pair didn't fit the same, and I ended up back at Square One. Got fitted with some Brooks and let the store folk talk me into a pair of their twice-as-expensive OTC orthotics, only to find they didn't do the trick. So just in case, I ordered another pair of the Powerstep Pinnacle ones, and relief for my LEFT foot was instant... but interestingly enough, my right foot wasn't so happy. NO worries, I just use the shoe's normal insert on my right, the Pinnacle on my left, and VOILA, I can work out pain-free again!!!

Random side note... for those of you who are - like I was several months ago - on a quest to find the perfect shoe and perfect orthotic for weird feet so that you can do any time of workout at any time, and was researching stuff online and devouring reviews for anything foot-related, let me add this: I have found that I need diff shoes and diff types of orthotics for diff activities.

I put them in a pair of Adidas Sambas, and while they fit, its significantly more snug.  Also, they're a bit too wide for the shoe and will require trimming for a perfect fit.

All and all they've help take off some pressure and pounding on my heels and my feet have felt better ever since!","05 3, 2012",7897,905
15413,3,A1DF9LKMYVB4XZ,B000KPIHQ4,"I was surprised at how uncomfortable these were in my Saucony Cohesion athletic shoes. I have used Powerstep Pinnacle inserts before with positive results in Asics shoes. I have an extremely high arch and a narrow heel, but not particularly narrow feet.

1) The worst problem was the width of the insert. While the arch support of these inserts is excellent (significantly better than the green Superfeet), the insert is wide in the heel and in the area of the arch, resulting in stretching the fabric of the shoe outward. It also seems that, due to the width of the insert, it may not fit flatly into the bed of the shoe; in my case this resulted in the left insert tilting upwards on the instep, so that the arch of the insert made significantly more contact with the arch of my left foot than did the right insert. The heel cup is also pretty wide, certainly wider than the Superfeet equivalent. I wear these shoes all day at an active job and have developed leg fatigue, foot pain and now have shoes that are stretched out in the arch, giving less support than they did before in the inserts.

2)Oddly, given the width of the rest of the insert, the toe region is particularly narrow and short. Although I purchased the correct size to match my shoe, the length of the insert was maybe 1/2"" shorter than the toe bed of the shoe, so my toes ended up sticking out over the top of the insert. While not particularly uncomfortable, it was annoying.

Perhaps this particular shoe and insert are incompatible. The instructions for the insert indicate to wear them intermittently at first, to allow your feet to acclimate to the support, so now I have a set of used inserts that I would absolutely return if I could. I'm very disappointed and hope that the inserts haven't entirely ruined my new shoes which are now stretched-out in the arch. I'm going to try Spenco Runner/Walker insert and look into returning these Powersteps.","04 29, 2012",2179,94

Sounds like it is plantar fasciitis  I figured before I made a trip to the doctor, I'd give this product a shot based on the positive reviews it was getting on Amazon.  I'm on my feet all day, walking at least 4 miles a day... so staying off my feet to let it heal is not an option for me.

The product fit nicely in my shoe, and is pretty comfortable.
Within a week, I noticed the pain was reducing.  It's been almost a month now and the pain is barely in my foot.

The tops of my feet were pressed tightly against the top of the shoes. After wearing them for an hour, I could barely walk.

Maybe they would work for someone with ""thinner"" feet. I would say that my feet are average sized, not super thick or unusually shaped--I buy standard size/width shoes.

Also, after you've inserted the orthotic, you'll have to loosen the shoelace because it takes up quite a lot of room. Also, it will make your feet appears ""bigger"" and more robust, which is not really pleasant looking (but yea I understand it is not about the look but you know I'm just saying)

Yet, every time I put the insert in a shoe, it lifted me too much in the heel that I kept slipping out.  I have small feet and slip out of most shoes anyway.  (And yes, I have tried the fancy lacing in the extra hole at the top of running shoes. It doesn't help.)  The heel cup was designed to grip your heel and keep it in place, but does not work for me. It should if you have a more normal size foot, but don't quote me on that.  Also, this one is more pliable than the original Powerstep insert.  If you need a little give on your insert, this would likely be the better option.","03 28, 2012",7227,938

15424,3,A2BFGIKSFHJQJ6,B000KPIHQ4,"This product seems durable and well-made.  I am sure that they work great for many people.  However, for others it could cause additional pain.  Before getting these, you should consider seeing a professional.  Wearing orthotic inserts such as these changes the alignment of your feet, ankles, spine, etc, and if these aren't right for you, it could cause you serious problems.

I am an active 24-year old.  I am a nursing student (on my feet for 7+ hours several times a week), I jog, I take my dog on hikes.  I have ridiculously flat feet and have worn the same pair of custom-made orthotics from a podiatrist for almost 10 years, and they have been wonderful.  When my dog chewed them up, I didn't want to  shell out several hundred dollars to go to a podiatrist, so I decided to try these out.  BIG MISTAKE.  I wore them for a few weeks, and experienced slight pain in the evenings.  I figured my feet were just adjusting or I just needed to wear them more (stupid, I know).  Then, a few days ago my back just gave out on me.  I have injured my back by wearing these insoles that are not the right shape for my feet.  Right now I can hardly walk or even sit up without severe pain.  I'll be going to a podiatrist soon for a new pair of custom orthotics.

So, take this as a cautionary tale.  If you have problems with your arches, you should consider seeing a professional before trying a generic product that might cause you more harm than good.  While this product is well-made, it is not for everyone.","03 19, 2012",2545,762

My arches were too tight, causing a pull on other muscles, etc., causing very painful walking, even limping. These inserts eventually got comfortable and stretched out my arch and made it more flexible. I haven't had the problem since. I also combined this with calf stretches. A lot of sitting, like at a desk, allows the calf muscles to tighen up and pull on the heel, causing heel pain. These really work.","10 24, 2011",15615,48

In a few days my foot is back to normal I do not have pain in my arch anymore. i am really happy with these.

With the Powersteps in my shoes it's no problem -- the level of support is just right for me.  I've been using the newer Maxx version in my daily-wear shoes, and those are even more comfortable than the regular Pinnacles, but the extra padding might not be a good idea in some cases.  For example, I'll probably keep wearing the regular Pinnacles in my tennis shoes, because they don't slip and the padding is just enough to be comfortable without feeling sloppy or too springy.

15487,5,APWXR3IIR2RCT,B000KPIHQ4,"I got these and a pair of Superfeet Black about a month ago for my SO after reading through hundreds of reviews here at amazon and also at zappos. He is 55, has very flat feet and suffers from what he calls ""hot heels."" In his work he attends numerous trade shows and after a day on concrete flooring he is in intense pain.

He was immediately attracted to the heel cushioning aspect of the Powerstep Pinnacles and went on to wear them for a couple of hours a day for several days. He said that they began alleviating his pain almost immediately. He felt the insoles repositioning his feet during the break in period and used that to guide him as to how long to wear them before taking a break. In any case, they've been show-tested and although he is not pain free he finds them very helpful and I am going to get him several more pairs here at amazon for distribution throughout his flock of footwear. If I were going to buy one pair only I probably would get them on ebay where several vendors offer them for about the same money with free shipping.

He typically wears Merrells, boots and outdoor sport type shoes, in a 10-10.5-11 size range. Swapping out the Merrell insoles with a pair of 10-10.5 size G Powerstep Pinnacles was simple and easy and did not require altering the insoles in any way.

Regarding the Superfeet Black, he did try them out. They are currently installed in a pair of his Merrell Chameleon mid height boots, which I notice he's not been wearing.  When I asked him about the Superfeet he told me that because the Superfeet do not have the immediate cushioned feel of the Powersteps he doesn't feel inclined to persist with them. Now I just spent several minutes examining the two pairs of boots housing the new insoles and, to me, although the Superfeet are overtly sans cushion there really isn't a whole lot of what I would call cushioning in the Powersteps either. But apparently it makes all the difference for him.

I wanna say that I am profoundly grateful for all of the information freely available from the amazon community in these reviews. You folks surely are a generous bunch and I continue to be amazed by and very thankful for you.","07 31, 2011",8341,379

For one main reason, they don't move around in the shoe which causes you to take your shoe off to re-adjust the insole back into place.  Plus, they seem to provide more comfort to the feet all together, not just to the heel of the foot.  If you want to try something that gives you more comfort for your feet and will stay in place.

It makes the day bearable instead of miserable. I can still walk at the end of a day, which is more than I could say before.

I find I have to replace them a few times a year, and I always move the old sets to less frequently used shoes, like slippers and such.  If they're too big, especially in the toe area, I cut them right in front of the hard plastic part to make them about half the length (especially true if I can't get the old insole out of the shoe without tearing it up).  This gives a little more room and actually lowers the front of the foot slightly, making a little more support in the middle.

The pain in the heel of my right foot got worst with each passing day.  Not having immediate access to a foot specialist, I contacted one in Doha, Qatar, who reccommended I search the internet for a 'Powerstep' orthotic insert to use until I returned to the states.  Searching the internet revealed several locations for the same insert with varied prices. I purchased a pair for under $25 ( I would have paid more), and they arrived in less than 10 days...I was desperate, as walking and standing had become almost un-bearable for me.  Those things worked like magic (they instantly became worth a lot more to me).  In fact, they had me feeling so much better that I went back on-line after a few days and tried ordering four additional pairs to put in my other shoes.  I only found one more pair for under $25, so I purchased it as a back-up until I can get a custom fitting.  My feet feel ssoooooo good.

15524,5,A1Y2RDFCWSA3VY,B000KPIHQ4,I purchased two pairs of these orthotics for my husband and adult son who are both flat footed.  My husband's podiatrist actually recommended these inserts to improve an issue he was having with his ankle joints sagging due to his overpronation.  These immediately reduced his ankle pain and swelling and with regular use have corrected it.  My son had a similar problem with his knee due to his flat feet and these completely cured the problem.  Amazon offered these orthotics for more than $10 less than offered at our local store.  I always check out Amazon first whenever I need ANYTHING and I am never disappointed!,"12 2, 2010",5534,458
15525,5,A3CCMQB9E97HYF,B000KPIHQ4,I have diabetes and must be extremely careful about my feet.  These inserts provide exceptional support and are extremely comfortable.,"12 2, 2010",1766,704
15526,5,AL3G7RTXMGLDQ,B000KPIHQ4,"I have spent YEARS looking for a good pair of orthotics. I have tried almost every Dr. Scholls product and some of the drugstore brands. Some worked ok..others failed miserably. Others did not provide enough support, slid around in my shoes, or were just plain uncomfortable. These orthotics are what I have been looking for this whole time.

I have flat feet and spend most of my day on them (about 6 hours or so at work, plus plenty of time at home). When I first got these orthotics, I did follow the directions and only wore them for a few hours at a time to get used to them. After the first few times wearing them, I was not very impressed. They were a little uncomfortable and I felt the arches might be too far forward in my shoe. However, after continuing to break them in, my opinion changed drastically. I now wear these exclusively and have stopped using my other orthotics. In fact, I wore a pair of older ones and my feet hurt instantly. I had to switch to these immediately.

A couple tips for people wearing them the first time:

- Gradually break them in for a few hours a day for at least a few days. Increase the wearing time little by little.

- Be patient when making your judgment on these until after you wear them for at least a few full days.

- Some shoes might require the insoles being removed (most of mine did not however).

- These work really well for wide feet (they do not slide around like smaller and cheaper models; this alone is reason enough to get them for me!)

I will be purchasing another pair or two so I can don't have to keep switching them out every day. These are definitely worth the investment, and are inexpensive enough that if they don't work for you, it is not a huge financial loss. (Not to mention, Amazon returns are so quick and easy)

UPDATE - 2/11 - I have been wearing these EVERY DAY since I broke them in..a little more than two months. I have since gotten rid of the rest of my old insoles and have ordered another pair of these. My feet have never been more comfortable in years!! Since I wear a different pair of shoes to work almost every day, they have started to show some wear and tear around the edges. I would recommend getting a few pairs to minimize this damage. I will continue to update and hopefully be able to offer some positive feedback in regards to longevity.

UPDATE - 9/9 - After using these exclusively for 10 months, I have to replace a pair. The area where my ""big"" toe sits has worn straight through the pad and down to the hard plastic. This has created a strange feeling and makes them less comfortable to wear. My other pair is still in great shape. Not sure if it makes a difference, but the insoles that must be replaced stayed in my sneakers the entire time. The other pair I rotate into my dress shoes for work each day and other pairs of sneakers. Perhaps rotating them helps them air out and prevent deterioration?","11 30, 2010",15230,413

15544,5,A13Y53J8CAJL6A,B000KPIHQ4,"I don't buy anything anymore without first checking the reviews here on Amazon.  The reviews did not let me down.  These REALLY saved me during a recent reinjury of Plantar Fasciitis in my left foot.  While the arch support was just a little more than my foot needed, they did immediately take the pressure off and allow me to begin walking normally again.  My arch is a normal height and feet are otherwise healthy.  I really liked the extra padding in the Pinnacle.  It makes them more comfortable to wear.  The orthotic support is sandwiched between two layers of padding for that extra cushioning, unlike some of the other brands with only one layer of padding.  They also seem to be VERY well made.  This is why I gave them 5 stars.  I highly recommend them!

Note: These are designed for use in shoes with more room inside, like tennis shoes where you can loosen the laces a little if needed.  You will want to remove the existing insole before putting the Pinnacles in.  If you want a thinner pair for dress shoes or some casual shoes, Powerstep also makes an Original and a Slim Step 3/4 design that will fit shoes with less room inside.

The powerstep Pinnacle was the right combination of orthotic support and padding to get me on my feet again.  I'll retire these as soon as my foot heals and go back to regular insoles like the Spenco Polysorbs.  I just bought a pair of the Walk/Runner for my tennis shoes and a pair of the Cross Trainer for my casual shoes.  The Cross Trainer is thinner than the Walk/Runner and are easier to fit in casual shoes.  Both Spenco insoles have some arch support, but are not orthotics and do not provide as much support as the Powerstep line.

On the negative, the arch support in the Pinnacle Powerstep was just a little higher/more substantial than what I needed to properly fit my feet.  On the positive, Not only did they immediately allow me to start walking again, the shape fit my shoes better than the Spencos do.  If I ever hurt my foot again, I might try something different like the Spenco RX Orthotics instead.  They say the Spencos can be molded to fit your feet which may solve my (very minor) arch support complaint.  Since I haven't tried the Spenco Orthotics, I don't know if they would be better, the same or worse.  I also don't know if the Spenco RX Orthotics are padded as well as the Powerstep Pinnacles.  It's just when your foot hurts THAT BAD, you'll do ANYTHING to make it feel better.

One big lesson I learned from this is to always have a good pair of insoles in my shoes when doing anything physical - and to replace them at least once a year.  Shoes and insoles DO wear out.  Your feet (at least my feet do) need the extra support & cushioning of a good pair of insoles.  I hurt my foot while wearing an old pair of tennis shoes with worn out insoles that had no padding left.  I believe that if I was wearing a recent pair of the Spenco insoles in those shoes, I would not have injured my foot.

I know I'm reviewing a little more than just than just the Powerstep Pinacles here.  Given the amount of pain associated with this type of injury, I though a bit of a conversation would be more productive.  Good luck with your feet!","08 22, 2010",748,300

First, let me say they have great heel cushion. They slid into my sneaker very easily, and after a few steps, I could tell the shock absorption was much better than what I'd been using.

I kept the exercise easy, walking the dog around the neighborhood. I still had pain, but it was not as bad. I figured the pain would take a few days to go away.

It didn't. I still have pain, which is why I rated this 4 stars. I stretch every morning, several times during the day, I ice it, I take ibuprofen, I massage it, I do strengthening exercises...I thought shoe inserts would be the thing I needed to get rid of plantar fasciitis once and for all. It helped dull the pain a little more, but these aren't a cure.

I think the problem is I need more arch support. One reviewer recommend hard foam in addition to these inserts. I agree with that. I fold a paper towel, shape it to my arch, then tape it into my shoe. That seems to be working in combination with all the stretching and icing.

I have a high arch and was concerned at first that the arch in the Powerstep was not high enough to provide the benefits I needed, because some other medium-height supports did not help me.  This turned out not to be a problem.  After wearing the Powerstep for just a couple of days my heel problems were gone and my feet and knees felt well.  Apparently the shape of the support is just right to provide the benefit.

(Incidentally, my main problem has been heel spurs.  An insightful doctor told me that they would stop hurting after using arch supports for a couple of months.  He was right!  Heel cushions are not the solution - arch supports are.)

I  have also used the Powerstep basic model, which is the same orthotic but without the additional padding.  The Pinnacle is slightly more comfortable because of its softness.  However, because of its additional thickness it fits in only one of my pairs of shoes, while the basic model fits in nearly all of them.  If in doubt, buy the basic Powersteps, not the Powerstep Pinnacles.

The orthics are made of high quality plastic, which have lasted me for several months so far.  They are not as rigid and strong as the $300 variety, but I think that for the price they are reasonably sturdy.

15570,5,A2QHHHXTSOKMSX,B000KPIHQ4,"This is the second pair I've had in the past year.  Although the box says lifetime warrantee, that's not true.  However, my first pair did last an entire year.

Custom made orthotics, as you know, are supremely expensive.  I cannot imagine how much better $300.00 custom made orthotics are compared to these that I just bought for $30.00 here at Amazon.com.  They are that good!

The local store where I bought these last year charged me $50.00 plus the exhorbitant CA plus LA County sales taxes, which totals to be the highest in the entire United States now.

I briefly scanned some of the other reviews and one thing did stand out for me: there is a break in time period before you can wear these constantly without any foot pain.  But, once they are broken in for you particular feet and shoes, like me, you will fall in love with this product, no joke!

Although these can be worn in any shoes you have, I have found that using one pair per pair of different shoes helps me the best.

I use these with the black leather Brooks Addiction Walker shoes, which are $100.00 here on Amazon, so I will be buyting those, too, from Amazon in the future.  The first two (2) pairs I purchased were bought locally for $120.00 plus the aforementioned sky high sales tax.

These Brooks have lasted me an entire year, as well.  I bought a new pair about two weeks ago and then found the Pinnacle orthotics here at Amazon for only $30.00, full price, delivered to my door.

After putting the new pair in my new pair of Brooks shoes and walking around for a little while, I remembered why the break in period is needed.

I have tried numerous over the counter orthotics, and these Pinnacles are by far the absolute best ones, bar none.

Note: I wanted to try out the new Dr. Scholl's that are being advertised.  I found them along with the machine that's supposed to accurately tell you which model is going to help you the most at a CVS.  1) They cost $50.00 plus tax; 2) I had to use the Dr. Scholl's machine numerous times to get a Dx for the model that is supposed to be the best for my feet (get the message?).  The manner in which the Dr. Scholl's are packaged is extremely restrictive.  They are packaged in very hard plastic with a very small hole with which to be able to stick your finger in it to feel them, etc., without opening the package just to check them out, which you cannot do because that is considered theft.  Also, from what I could determine, there is zero toe support in the Dr. Scholl's orthotics.

Anyhow, I've digressed.  Without any hesitation whatsoever, I wholeheartedly recommend the pinnacle orthotics without any reservations whatsoever.  They are excellent and have helped me tremendously.

Just a note regarding shoes: I wanted to try the rocker walking shoes, you know, the ones that cost about $250.00 per pair.  I cannot wear any of the brands because my right heel is too narrow and they feel like thongs when I try to walk in them (a bummer for me).  Although I'm not rating the above noted Brooks shoes because it will be my next pair that I purchase from Amazon, for me, combined with the ortotics I am rating, I have not found any better combination of shoes + orthotics!

Lastly, I emphatically note that I have absolutely zero connection in any manner with Brooks or Pinnacle.

This combination of products, for me, has tremendously helped my lousy posture as well as pain due to medical conditions I shall not disclose.

Oh yeah, it looks like this review is only for the size I wear, but my review holds true for any size of these.","12 24, 2009",4286,123

They helped in a very short time.  They feel quite odd and hard for the first day or two, but then I didn't want to be without them and could walk or stand for MUCH longer MUCH more comfortably than before.  I decided to try the Powerstep Pinnacles this time.  While I like them much better than not having them in my shoes, I think I'll stick with the slightly less expensive regular Powerstep in the future.  These seem like they'd be more comfortable (there's more cushion in the heel), but I find my feet to be sore sooner than with a new set of the regular Powerstep.","12 24, 2008",18874,295

15581,5,A3R34WSTBSXHUK,B000KPIHQ4,"As a long time sufferer of fallen arches I've tried many insteps, from custom made to cheap drug store ones, none have worked as well as the Powerstep Pinnacles. I've been using them for something like 4 years now, maybe longer, after a foot Doc sold me a set after having him look into my foot pain issue. I tried a couple of the better drug store ones but found them no better then having none. They might be okay if you just want some cusion though.
 I have worked up to the point where I have a set in each of about 5 pairs of footware, started with just one set but moving them from one pair to another proved to be too much hassle.
 If you have sore arches to the point you can hardly walk, see the doc then try these out (if he suggests the $200 custom jobs, try these first). It took a month or so for the swelling to go down after starting to use these so give them a chance. Do keep in mind that your results will more then likely differ from mine, I just got lucky.","11 25, 2007",6126,506

1. Plastic studs are included if you don't own or plan to buy nice ones. From a distance, I think that they probably wouldn't be cheap-looking.

2. Buttons are sewn immediately below the stud holes so that if you'd rather use buttons, you don't have to use studs.

3. There are two holes for cufflinks on the ""inner"" part of the cuff that allow you to adjust the length of the sleeve. That can be very useful, since the sleeve lengths aren't offered at every inch increment. For example, you can buy a 34-35 or a 32-33, but if you need exactly a 34, the sleeve is actually closer to 34.5. The extra hole allows you to get a nearly exact 34"". Overall, the shirt was a perfect fit for me. Not easy when you're buying online.

The reason being the pleats go all the way to the bottom of the shirt, this makes the shirt a little ridged and heavy when you tuck it in. Most tux shirts have pleats only till the waist line.

Highly recommend cotton tux shirts. Odds are the activities you're participating in whilst wearing a tux are going to make polyester shirts feel like straitjackets once you work up a little sweat.

It looked GREAT and honestly, under a nice bow tie - links-studs and a sharp jacket and vest...I thought it looked just as nice as the Nordstrom one.

First, the cloth is decent cotton, but not the finest.  Not close to a brooks brothers or other similar national brand of shirt.  Second, and to me the bigger disappointment, was the fact that the shirt has built in collar stays - and if you've worn shirts with built in stays, you know they don't have quite the same collar quality and stiffness as one with normal collar stays.

Overall the shirt was very good. It did not have the fake wing-tips some reviewers mentioned, mine were the fold-over, part of the collar. The fabric was a nice weight, not too flimsy, not too heavy. It fit well in the arms, chest and waist, but was too big in the collar. I'm normally a 17, and this 17 seemed more like an 18. This made tieing my bow-tie extremely tedious with all the extra fabric around the collar, i could not get a nice snug knot.

Amazon Prime to the rescue, I found this shirt, which I liked MUCH better than the one the local store had at well over double the price.

I bought this expecting fold-over wing-tip collars (seamless, the wing tips are just part of the collar, pressed and folded over). Instead, I received the cheapo-version, with the little fake triangle-tip collar bits that are sewn onto the rest of the collar. I'm usually a 16 36/37. Got the 15.5 36/37 because the last shirt I had was too big in the neck. Even with this size, the neck was too big, and the sleeves were too short. To make it worse, the shirt shrank after the first wash and hang dry. I ended up pitching this shirt after two uses. Ignoring the misleading picture, still rating this low. Good luck.

I see people saying it was too small, it fit my daughter perfectly so maybe it works better as a children's wig.","09 27, 2014",17327,967

15956,2,A1H8YRVKZEX85E,B000LUVFA8,"I am disappointed in the way this ring looks when it is actually on a finger...It is VERY wide and the particular ring I got (I believe they are all different) looks crude and amateurish, with gaping ""holes"" in the wirework.  That said, when twisted the right way the ring is surprisingly comfortable and I think the ring could look very striking on someone with very long, very slender fingers.  I am planning on wiring stone beads into the gaps of the ring and giving it to my daughter, whose fingers are more suited to the style...we shall see what she thinks of it!","12 11, 2007",8615,878
15957,4,AWWV5LQNZWDQT,B000LUVFA8,"Unique and a good buy... and more sturdy than it looks in the picture.  I've been testing the loops with a reasonable amount of force and they do not bend.

Given the comments from previous reviewers, I was prepared to receive something that might look rather shoddy, but it is not shoddy.  Obviously not the best quality silver, but still good for the price.  Well-polished.

The inside has a small raised bit of silver (where it was soldered) which scratches my finger a little when I slide the ring on - unless I rotate it first to a better position.  It is not sharp and does not leave any marks, and once on, the ring fits very comfortably.  So this is a minor problem.  Obviously these imperfections will vary from piece to piece - this is the nature of the design.

The ring does not catch on my clothing.

Wish this ring came in size 5.  Other reviewers have reported that the sizes run a little smaller than standard, but I ordered the size 6 and it is still somewhat loose on my pointer finger.","11 6, 2007",12227,83

15963,4,AWN4HPGPMLJ3I,B000LUVFA8,I love this ring because it is so unique and people always have good comments to give me about it. My only complaint is that the ring is hard to keep clean.

15965,2,A2EK7J6I4QRFSZ,B000LUVFA8,"I received lots of compliments on this unique ring. But, the trouble that I've had getting just the right fit after resizing and keeping the ring from tarnishing makes it hard for me to recommend.","05 28, 2008",11035,190
15966,2,AJX30GGT76NPT,B000LUVFA8,"This ring is Beautiful and artistic, however, after wearing it off and on for about a week, one of the wire split, leaving two sharp ends exposed. i tried to sorta 'bend' them into the design, where they wouldn't be dangerous or noticable; but it just didn't work. after braving the danger, another wire or two broke.
i'd say i put medium wear on my jewelry and i realize this is somewhat fragile, but i definately expected more from it and was disappointed. Now i'm not sure WHAT to do with it.
I'd think twice unless you have a super-cushy job that doesn't require getting your hands dirty or frequent washing. DEFINATELY not a ring for a mom!!!","05 4, 2008",18302,309
15967,4,A1NLP5N0RPKJZG,B000LUVFA8,"It looks exactly like the picture. The ring looks delicate but feels sturdy and is very unique but do be aware that it can easily snag on clothes. If you're unsure about the size, I'd suggest order a larger size because there's no flexibility in the ring. It's fairly comfortable but wide so be sure you really like it before buying. I'm very happy with it!","02 28, 2008",748,300
15968,3,A1OZVXHAQ9EGQD,B000LUVFA8,"First, I *do* like this ring, however the rest of my review may sound.  That being said, the first thing I noticed was that it's sized rather small. It's quite a snug fit, so I recommend ordering a size up from what you normally would order.  The second thing I noticed was that it really doesn't look like the picture - the wire is much thicker than I was expecting and wasn't put together very well. I have to wear it *just so* so that you can't see the giant holes in the ""filigree"".  The band is also quite wide, so some people (such as myself) might have trouble bending whatever finger they wear this ring on.  Then today, as I was giving my finger a rest from wearing it, I noticed that IT TURNED MY FINGER GREEN! Sterling silver does NOT turn my fingers green. I could deal with wearing it a certain way and only for short periods of time, but turning my finger green? It's junk.","02 20, 2008",5812,817

All my life my sisters and I have worn those little satin scarves from beauty stores or discount department stores like walmart and target. But with my new hair routine I'm only using the best- the best products, best oils, and the best scarves. I knew that silk was the best I could do, so I searched the net and narrowed down my search to a scarf I found on ebay and on here. This one for its size is the best.

The 30 by 30 in black for 24 dollars plus shipping is a steal. My hair retains so much moisture. I also purchased a silk pillow case (the pillowcase happened to be cheaper on ebay).

What I love most about this scarf is the size- it even fits when I sleep with big rollers (after setting my hair)- it still covers my hair nicely.

Great buy and I feel all women of color should have a silk scarf for their hair, it retains so much more moisture, and this scarf will last substantially longer than those little satin scarves.","08 2, 2009",136,569
16161,4,A3ATYCL34CDA0U,B000MQFSTU,"Written by recipient ;)

There are other reviews which are somewhat critical of the packaging.  Personally I don't care about that.  The silk was of good quality and the color was even and consistent - not always the case at this price point.  The only real issue was the measurements.  We would have liked a wider longer version and we would have given them 5 stars.  10-12"" by 5 ft would be great.  If you are small busted and petite then these will be GREAT for you, but if you have a serious bust then the simple knot will not work the ends will stick out on you.","08 9, 2008",977,743

It's essentially a small, thin rectangle of cheap cloth with sloppy seams. It MIGHT be worth $4-5, but there is no way I would pay $23 for it had I seen it in person first. ""Scarf"" is definitely a generous term because it's too small to function as one, unless you're a surprisingly fashionable, premature infant.

It's fine as a blindfold, but it won't completely obstruct vision.

16230,5,AI0E9VSHO6WTP,B000MQFSTU,"I purchased the brown scarf almost a month ago. I probably read all the reviews before purchasing this scarf. Cant remember all of them now but an old reviewer said the stitching was off so I wasn't sure about the quality. I learned that the quality of silk  is based on weight & measured in mm. There wasn't any reference to this & someone said they can see through the scarf.  I made my final decision to buy this scarf based on the review about the person who did research said this is a good price & she recommended the larger 30 x 30, if your intend is for hair care. This along with a travel pillow case are my first silk purchase.( I bought them same day or a day apart) The scarf is very soft, smooth, & intact stitching all the way around. This has a nice light weight but very soft sturdy quality product. It is not see through as someone claimed. I compared my new silk pillowcase too my new silk scarf & the pillowcase is soft & of good quality. However, in comparison this scarf is of great quality & superior in softness. Its super smooth but not slippery. I wear this scarf on my head EVERY night for my Afro - textured hair. I measured the scarf & its exactly as described. It shipped fast in a fed ex envelope, packaged in clear wrapping, included  description of product, return information, not sure what else. The scarf does have a label that reads dry clean only on the inside, I that part off. I believe someone was upset about the packaging being clear plastic? It was wrapped in the same clear material that you would get if you bought a button down collar shirt @ a department store but without all the extra cardboard & unnecessary clips. The only problem now is I love my scarf so much I want silk linen. lol . Almost  forgot I was excited to get my scarf so I did take several pics with my phone. However, I don't know how to get this phone to upload to my computer, so when I figure it out I will post pics of my brown scarf. FYI.  A silk scarf  can maintains hairstyle, holds moisture in your hair & prevents hair loss from friction. Cotton pulls moisture out of hair & snags hair right off of your head while you sleep. All hair types can experience dryness so the benefits of a silk scarf not just limited to black people or women.","05 9, 2013",13201,642

The second hand aligns perfectly on my watch with the slash marks. The accuracy of time keeping is slightly less impressive - mine gains 7 seconds a month, or about 1 1/2 seconds a week. Not the most accurate Seiko I've ever owned, in fact my Pulsar keeps slightly better time, as it gains only around 4 seconds/month.
And yet, this model exemplifies the spirit and ethos of SEIKO (which means ""exquisite"" ).

I have a few needs when it comes to a watch, and those are easy readability, day/date, a sapphire crystal, and a screwed-down caseback. This Seiko has all of that, and the very lightweight titanium case is a fun plus. For around $150-200, you get all of the hallmarks of a fancy watch, and the shiny white dial with bright lume+polished markers makes for a piece that can be worn with dressier attire or casual wear.

I read the previous reviews and was afraid to purchase because there seemed to be mixed feelings about it, but I am glad that I did.  It's great quality material and serves the purpose for which I purchased it for.  Yes it came in a little plastic envelope, but I don't care too much about the packaging.  Great quality, good size, and a pretty good price.  I think I made a good choice.  I will say that the color wasn't what I thought it would be.  I ordered the 30""x30"" in fuschia but it looked more like a bright pink.  I still like it.  If you're looking for a good silk scarf for your hair I would definitely purchase it.  I'm even considering purchasing  the longer one to use as maybe a winter scarf for further hair protection during the winter.  Rather have silk rubbing against my nape than a cotton scarf.

No doubt they will eventually re-appear, but I missed not having a pair since I use them every morning to get in and out of the bath, and even to wear around my residence.  There was a slight glitch during the delivery process since this item was shipped by DHL Home to my P. O. Box, and DHL does not generally deliver to P. O. boxes.  The moment I realized that the shipment had been sent out by DHL, I contacted Amazon customer service and spoke to a nice woman by the name of Tasha (Amazon has a service where their customer service people will call YOU immediately, and this is exactly what Tasha did), who was very helpful and ensured that this delivery would get to me in the event that DHL was not able to leave my package with the Post Office.  I am not sure what transpired, exactly, but the package arrived at the Post Office yesterday, 2 days before it's scheduled delivery date and I was able to pick it up last night.  I have to say that all of my experiences with Amazon have been very positive, and I have recommended them to many people. The flip-flops themselves are comfortable, although I was surprised by the rough, raised pattern on the surface of the foot pad.  Intially, I wasn't sure that I would like walking on it, but now it feels like getting a little foot massage. I bet the surface texture was added so that the your feet don't slide when the flip-flops get wet.  If so, this is welcome. Since it is now the winter season, the store where I purchased the pair I misplaced currently has none in stock. This is another nice feature of shopping Amazon.com.

The ""Top"" logo did not appear on mine either, even though the pictured flip-flop clearly shows it.  I own a pair of Top Havaianas purchased from a store, and the quality of these is much better.  The ONLY reason I'm keeping them is because I have not been able to find a true navy blue pair anywhere else.  The color for women seem to be more royal blue.  I also believe that these are men's flip-flops, and not women's, as navy blue seems to be a man's color choice. My straps are also turned in and rough on the edges.","07 7, 2017",4286,123

I have ever so slightly narrow feet and this are not too wide for me. If you have wide feet, I don't think these will work for you. I don't find that I need break-in time for my Havaianas, but I'm used to wearing thong-style sandals. My previous pair lasted 3 summers and were going strong until they got covered in crude oil from a beach overseas (gross! and no way to save them). There really is a huge difference between Havaianas rubber flip flops and the super cheap ones you get at an Old Navy or the like. The soles of these don't smoosh down and flatten out like cheaper imitations. The thong between the toes didn't loosen or come detached and I lived in my previous pair. New pair has already handled a 4 day Florida trip and look like new. Marine Blue color is a true, royal blue and I find them to be a fun pop of color even when I'm not wearing blue. Because it's a deeper shade (as pictured), they don't show dirt or smudges.","03 14, 2016",6899,84

So these might be better if you fit whole sizes, not half. They're comfortable and last forever.

The original pair hurt my feet when walking, they rubbed in between my toes & cut the skin.
So I used them in the shower where I don't walk :)

Those originals finally got black with mildew  & after trying several things to clean them I tossed them & replaced them with these.
I haven't tried walking with them but the post between the toes do feel strong.
So many people buy, walk with & love this make of shoes so maybe it's my feet that are less robust than others that make them sore. I have found that other similar flip flops & sandals my feel between my toes get a bit sore at 1st but then my feet get used to them & toughen up but that didn't happen with these for me. You may have better luck.
But for the shower they are fine. I think I just need to scrub them more often with soapy water to keep the mold at bay in this humid weather.

later: I just compared these new flip flops with the pair I'm throwing out & the post between the toes is thinner so things have changed & maybe I'd do better walking in these now.","07 31, 2014",10566,102

I wear anywhere between a 9 and a 10 in US Women's, and the sizing chart said that would be a 39/40; this was accurate as they fit perfectly.

When I received the shoe it was too small and the shoe was clearly stamped size 7/8. So I enlisted the help of customer service to order the correct size. I was reassured the first pair was just a mistake and since I needed a size 9 he again ordered me the br 39/40 us 9/10. Guess what? Wrong again!  shoes came stamped with size 7/8! Ok so thought I'd give it one more try and this time ordered size br 41/ US 11/12 in a different color..they arrive and fit perfectly. this time the shoes are stamped with a size 9. HOWEVER the strap on the right foot is twisted in such a way that it wouldn't lay flat against my foot and was very uncomfortable plus unbelievably it's a different color than the rest of the shoe it's like it had been faded out or something!

The straps seem a tad on the narrow side, but nothing to cause a blister, even on the longest of summer vacations.  That said, I've always been eager to have my driving foot bare when wearing them. Nothing untoward has happened, but the fit makes it so that driving barefooted is less anxiety-provoking than with the Havaiana on my right foot.  There's just something about the feel when in driving position - and, to be fair, these aren't driving mocs! LOL -
While the other flip-flops are still an option, we see them more as costume adornments to be worn a few times and repurposed, or donated, while the Havaianas are real keepers.
So, if the straps feel a bit snug at first, as in our cases, they stay that way all summer but never cause even one blister, so, no need to return them (for us).
And, if the 10x more than Old Navy, etc gives you pause:Think of them as tires for your feet and know you'll be receiving many mores miles in exchange for the price - (but, $3 Old Navy's are A-OK too, we just got ourselves some of those this week - but expect only 1 to 10 wears from them, tops - Havaianas, on the other hand have seen us through many months of 2013 and still look like they're brand-new!

16874,2,A3AX9BHNMKDOBN,B000NBIMY2,"I bought a pair of blue havaianas from a department store 3 years ago. I never liked sandals much, but that pair was amazingly comfortable. Last summer, I got tired of bringing them back and forth between home and college and decided it was time to buy a new pair anyway.

I decided to go with a brown pair, but much to my disappointment, they were some of the most uncomfortable sandals I have ever worn. I pretty much avoid wearing them at all costs. Even though my blue sandals' thong keeps coming out, I'd still much rather wear those than these brown ones. Straight out of the packaging, the thongs were crushed and twisted in such a way that you can't just stuff your feet in them. You have to manipulate them around with your hands before your feet will fit. No amount of shaping has corrected this issue. The platform is also incredibly hard. It does not feel like how my old blue ones felt like at all, even straight out of the packaging. I understand this might be a breaking in issue, but I don't recall my blue ones being this uncomfortable.

Needless to say, I've worn these sandals maybe thrice since purchasing them.","07 8, 2013",13136,481

16932,5,AOL5QT3HCQBWA,B000NBIMG0,"These are definitely my favorite flip flops. I got a pair in Navy Blue a few years ago and absolutely loved them. Somewhere along the way I lost track of them and I've missed them ever since. Living in the heat of the South, I've gone through several pairs of flip flops over the years but never quite fell in love with any as much as these. Or if I did love a pair I would wear them so much they would break down and fall apart... some even developed funky odors rendering them unwearable.

Admittedly it may seem a bit odd to be professing love for a pair of flip flops. In particularl these as they are fairly standard looking as far as flip flops go. But there's just something about the shape of this particular brand and model (the Top, not the Slim) that seems to flatter my foot more than any other flip flop. I can't explain it. Is it because I have wider than average feet? Anywho, aside from vanity they're just super comfy and their weight is ideal - not too heavy and bulky, but still of substance. They're also very convenient - good at the beach/pool/shower and they also have enough cushioning (for me at least) to do plenty of walking if I need to. Of course, as with any flip flop, I would not go hiking or do any activities that would require actual traction. They aren't as sturdy as, say, Rainbows, but honestly I far prefer the feel of rubber under my feet. I tend to find leather very drying. Still, though, they are sturdy enough and they seem to hold up to wear and tear with ease so I trust they will last quite a while, assuming one doesn't lose them.

Thus, for the aforementioned reasons, I finally got myself another pair, again in Navy Blue a few months ago when they were on sale and I have not been disappointed. A note on sizing - I generally wear a women's size 8, on the nose. Apparently, after looking through my order history, when I ordered these the first time I got a size 39/40 (US 8/9). This time, for some unknown reason I ended up ordering a size 37/38 (US 7/8) and the fit feels perfectly fine to me. Maybe my feet have shrunk? Honestly I don't remember ever being dissatisfied with larger size, so my thinking is that the sizing might be rather flexible. If you prefer tighter fitting flops order down, if you prefer having plenty of flop behind your heel order up. But who knows, maybe I have weird feet.

Oh, and for reference - in the picture of the flip flops next to a black slide on - the black slide on is size 8 & 1/2. I threw in the blue notebook for color reference. I suppose size 37/38 does just barely fit my foot, but that's the way I prefer it as I usually end up tripping over flip flops that are much longer. As long as my foot's not falling off the edge of the shoe I'm happy.","07 31, 2015",5545,716

16941,5,AWVYGU3VEHL0W,B000NBIMY2,I love Havianas!  I bought my first pair in Australia in 2005 and went back to the store for another pair in a different color a few days later.  I wear them almost every day in the summer.  They're very comfortable and wear like iron!  The only reason I'm ordering some now is because a new puppy chewed up my favorite brown pair and I'm getting navy blue also.  The black pair that I've had since 2005 are still in great shape.,"05 18, 2012",8646,686
16942,4,A2JCKVOLBYCZC2,B000NBIMY2,These are sturdy for flip flops and actualy comfortable which you do not usually find in a flip flop. My only complaint and it may just be me but they hurt/rub between my toes.,"03 25, 2012",15237,954
16943,4,A3FS62MLDCQLH8,B000NBIMY2,"I bought these Havaianas on amazon because I heard that this brand was great for flip flops, so I wanted to try it out. I get anxious when ordering items that have sizes online since I don't want to accidentally order the wrong size. So I went to various sites including the original Havaianas store online and checked that I was ordering the right size. However, when I got my package in the mail and I put the flip flops on, the back of my heel protruded at least a good inch or so. I was quite sad when this occurred after all my hard work of trying to find the right size. Thankfully, my roommate was interested in buying them so I didn't have to return the shoes.

I think I might order a pair my size in the future though. I still want to test how comfortable these shoes are!","09 24, 2011",4659,847
16944,5,A2OTLF3UQUSN8G,B000NBIMY2,"After buying a cheapo flip flop in the past, I can say that it's definitely worth forking out the big bucks for a good quality Havaianas. My cheapos, lasted a week, the foam started to shrink and the color discoloured onto my feet. My Havaianas on the other hand have maintained their thickness. They don't stain my feet (I've got black ones) and I've worn them to everywhere (even riding my bike). Best part is, they are so comfy.","09 16, 2011",1888,430

16946,5,A14DFR1WG12V80,B000NBIMY2,"These are THE BEST flip flops ever. Seriously, I mean it!  I live Austin, TX and the flip flop is the unofficial state shoe almost year round, however, the heat and humidity here can really take a toll on the poor standard flip flop and they burn out (at least mine did) within a month of being put into use. But not Havaianas! These last for the long haul and their pretty designs do not rub off or fade after repeated wearing.  They last so long that it is hard to justify buying more than one pair, but I haven't let that stop me!  If you are looking for a durable, pretty little flip flop for the summer - you can do no better than these. The price may be a bit more than your standard drug store $1.99 variety but Havaianas are well and truly worth it.","08 27, 2010",3558,348
16947,1,A3AW2ZG0GP4SKN,B000NBIMY2,I tired these flip flops thinking they would be comfortable but I ended up giving them away.  Nothing special.,"07 15, 2010",18155,252
16948,3,A1SSQ3QDDOFV13,B000NBIMY2,"I thought I would try some Havianas because  I have been seeing them all over the internet. When I was a kid we always used to have what we called ""zoris"" for most of the summer and part of the rest of the year. Growing up in California, these were the obligatory shoes for kids. And cheap. Havianas aren't cheap, but I thought I would try a pair to see if they were sturdier than discount store thong flip flops. The one problem with thong flip flops is they wear out. And a lot of the ones you can purchase at discount stores are made of very cheap materials, not rubber, like they used to do back in the day. These appear to be made of rubber, and it seems like they will last longer than the discount ones. That being said, they probably won't last all that much longer, and they also have very high straps for some weird reason. You can tell this from the photo. I don't have skinny feet; my feet are somewhat akin to a ducks and are thick, but these were very loose and when wearing a thong sandal, you don't want loose straps. I purchased another pair in another color and they were the same so I am assuming this is true for all Havianas. Big box retailers, some of who sell here on Amazon I was happy to find, are now making thongs in more rubber-like materials and I bought some really sturdy retro ones the other day for $2.50. So this was the last pair of Havianas I will be purchasing, regardless of the cute patterns and colors they have. Save your money and just buy another pair of the color you like best at the big box store or here on Amazon so when the first ones wear out, you still have the same color. I could buy 4 pairs and have the same thong for a lot longer than these Havianas will last me, that's for sure.","03 31, 2010",9977,166

The most recent pair I bought are the slim ones and the size stamp on the sole says 37/38BR and usa 7/8W.  These are the ones I looked at to determine the sizing when I ordered these.  I ordered 37/38BR US 7/8 but when they just came, the size stamp on the sole says BR37/38 BUT USA 6 and I tried them on and they seemed smaller than my other Top Flip Flops with the wider band.  So then I looked at my other Havaianas with the wide band and they all have a size stamp of 39/40 and USA 7/8.  So what I determined is that the slim fit ones are specifically sized for women and the wide bands ones are actually mens sizes.  Anyways, if it helps, I wear a 37/38 USA 7/8 W in the slim band Havaianas and a 39/40 USA 7/8 in the wide band ones and I am between an 8 and a 9 in normal shoes depending on the brand.

They are the only flip flop (that isn't high-end leather) that doesn't rub or tear the skin on my feet. The Top version (not the slim) lasts years, if only you can avoid having them stolen from the beach.  No need to fill landfills with your other cheapies that fall apart or look gross after a few months. They are very comfortable if you don't require arch support. I take mine with me wherever I go: from ashrams, to beaches, to gym showers, with fashion, as my house tropical house slippers, and everywhere and in-between. Made in Brazil, not China. I typically wear size 7 1/2 dress shoe and size 8 - 8 1/2 running shoe or boots and I wear size 39 in Havaianas (my foot is close to the edges as I tend to trip if there is extra space at the toe).

Usually its flip flops with Designs that feel this way. Well these don't have any AND the Havaianas with designs NEVER feel sticky or anything. If anything--the coating they put makes them feel EVEN NICER TO WEAR!!(or I am guessing, I have no idea if they put a coating on the design of their flip flops...)  anyway--I keep trying to wear them.. even around the house. I have washed them im my washer a few times, and as a matter of fact they are in my washer AGAIN in hopes of them being a bit more nicer feeling on the feet. The flip flops came dusty. Kinda nasty, but they do not look like knock offs in comparasion to the other Havaianas I have here at home. I just don't know :( I might stick to Nordstroms for my Havaianas or to the Official Havaianas site to buy any other pairs of flip flops.....not sure I will buy again from Amazon.

I put them as okay because, given the size I have to wear, they are ""okay."" They're pretty comfortable, even if they're not easy to slip on and off, and I like that the heel is higher in the back.

I purchased these flip flops for $17.99 in May '13 and the top of
the toe thong on the right flip flop broke yesterday. :(

I love my flip flops and spent extra money to buy a good pair. Based on customer reviews on Amazon, these were the ones to get! They fit well, are very comfortable, and seemed to made better than the rest.

I kept checking the bottom of the flip flop to see how much they had worn down and was confident that I had spent my money wisely. The bottom of the shoe (where most flip flops fail) was barely noticely worn at all! These seem to made from more durable materials so I don't know why they failed on the TOP of the toe thong.

Once you break them in they form to your feet and you feel like you have nothing on.  I have hiked, swam, walked, biked, etc. in these slippers.  Plus, I am rather clumsy and would trip a lot in other sandals because the sole was so stiff.  Not Havaianas!!!  My whole family, men and women swear by them and want no others.

They are still as comfortable and look great as when i first bought them from the store even though I've worn them so much from going to the beach, pool, vacation, to the grocery store, shopping, checking mail, running errands, yeah the list is endless and they still are good to go except the bottom sole which finally made me have to buy news ones.

I do find that the sizing runs a little ""bigger"" then what it used to but i really do not mind it one bit. The news are just as great and identical to the ones i bought so many years ago and have absolutely loved. I know a lot of people are going to be like are you kidding me that's disgusting keeping them same pair for so many years.....hmmhmh...NO! It isn't since the style is identical no one knows how long you've had them for, for starters and since they weren't worn out why would i replace them until i actually had to?

I probably have almost all the available colors by now and i do favor the top flip flop style compared to the others one available but that it is just my personal opinion.

You get beyond a bang for your buck on this pair!! I DEFINITELY recommend and would buy again and again and again...Simply love these flip-flops! Super comfortable, stylish and literally everlasting.","06 1, 2012",187,953
17302,5,A174NYS7K8Q24K,B000NBIMG0,"I own several pairs of Havaianas and was a little concerned about ordering them online after perusing the reviews.  I decided to go ahead and order a pair in same size as my other ones, a 39/40, and they fit perfectly. All of the other pairs I own I bought in person, so I had the benefit of trying them on ahead of time. I hadn't realized that a 39/40 translates to a size 9/10, so it would appear that these do run large. I am a true size 8 in all of my other shoes but I am apparently a 9/10 in Havaianas.

I would recommend that before ordering them online you try them on in person if possible to guarantee size accuracy. They are much cheaper on amazon than in other retail stores I've been to so I am very pleased with my purchase. I find them to be more comfortable and durable than any other flip flop brand. I've had my other pairs for years and have put them through a lot of abuse and they still look and feel great. If you have very sensitive feet or are prone to sweating, these may not be the right sandal for you. Because they are rubber, they are easy to clean and never smell like other foam flip flops.","05 26, 2012",9386,684

Wearing 2 of these rings stacked together, fit VERY tightly, and were VERY hard to get off. Wearing all 3 of these rings stacked together, did NOT fit at all. 2) The sides DO stick out. Which IS noticeable, looks-wise, AND comfort-wise. 3) The ""Middle Ring"" IS warped. It is NOT straight across the bottom. It is wavy on the bottom. 4) I have had Diamond, and CZ, stacked eternity band style rings before, and these rings do NOT measure up. Not even *1* of these rings, is worth keeping all 3 of them. I will say, however, that they are very sparkly. And, I'm disappointed, that they didn't work out. I wish that they were better made.

The middle ring (second ring in the stack) stones are larger than the other two rings.  Was hoping based on other reviews they would all be the same size.

It's very comfortable and true to size. I find it quite attractive and believable, not at all gaudy.  One of the things I really like about it is the stones on one of the rings are larger. I like to wear that ring alone if I'm traveling somewhere I don't want to draw attention to my jewelry. I only wish I had found this years ago.  If you travel for work or pleasure I highly recommend this ring.","09 2, 2014",15991,601

Don't purchase these hoping they will pass for the real thing - they are fakes, but in a Swarkovski kind of fashion.  Meaning they sparkle and look nice, but not like real diamonds.  Also, I do not have the problem some did with them hurting my other fingers.  I bought the size 6 and feel it is just a tiny bit too small - I still wear it and it doesn't bother me, but at the end of the day sometimes they are a little difficult to get off.","05 18, 2014",13111,892

Very sparkly and the stones seem to be very well set. The fit seems to be true. I usually wear a 6.5 on my left ring finger, and I ordered a 7 so i could have some flexibility and wear it on my right hand as well.

Oddly enough, one of the three bands has larger cz stones than the other two. It's not dramatic, but it's noticable. I don't really care, but i thought it was strange.","01 27, 2014",16348,356

They're meant to be worn by someone who can rock the chunkier looking stuff but they are not overly big in my book! The two outside rings are a tad smaller in stone size then the middle and they are fun to wear with other rings or stacked together on one finger.

So in the interim I want to wear a ring and have always been attracted to the stacked look. This set is sharp and fabulous. SO many compliments; more than I got with my original setting.  I'm hard on my hands. Working in the yard, overusing bleach (clean freak) and although this set is very affordable, it's also durable. The silver is as silver as the day it arrived and the simulated diamonds sparkle. It does NOT look cheap.

The feel was a bit awkward at first, as is usual with any new ring but now I can't even tell I'm wearing it. The day after I received these rings, I had to make a trip to the jeweler. Right away the jeweler commented, ""What a beautiful ring."" She didn't realize at first that it was sterling silver and cubic zirconia's. I recommend this ring for sure. It's stunning!","11 8, 2013",2978,215

Edit: My girlfriend still has this ring and still fawns over it constantly. I've bought her a myriad of jewelry over the course of our relationship and she keeps running back to this one. The gems are still shiny, it's fun to play with on your finger, it still looks stunning and is an eye catcher. She gets compliments on it rather frequently. It does bother her that only two of them lock, and the third just spins (even after trying all combinations possible), but all in all she's still very happy with this ring. Happy wife = Happy life. If she's happy, then I'm happy. I personally always wondered if the stone wrapping around the entire band would ever irritate or cut into her other fingers, but she says that it doesn't.

This fit the bill perfectly - although it is not real diamond, it compliments the real ring well. We liked that we got three rings for this price, so that we could choose between the slightly-larger or one of the smaller bands (we chose the smaller), and we now have a replacement band in case it gets lost. The only complaint I've heard from her is that after washing her hands, she gets bubbles and popping noises from the ring due to the holes on the inside of the band.

I really wanted to love them but I have to agree with the poster who said there is just something about them that makes them look fake and ""Made in China"" as stamped on the inside.  I can't pinpoint it exactly either.  This is definitely a case of you get what you pay for.  By looking at the metal, there is no way these would hold up to daily wear as wedding/anniversary bands.  It almost looks like tin foil and I can tell if would start flaking.  I am sure though the designer didn't necessarily intend these to be worn as every day rings.

Would be fun wear to a party or on the right hand but I put 2 of these on either side of my wedding band and engagement ring and it was laughable how fake they looked next to the real deal.  My setting is in platinum so that might not help but even if someone has white gold, these are not going to match.

As far as costume jewelry or something sparkly to wear on the right hand, these are cute little rings.  In that regard they should get a 5 star.","05 11, 2012",6113,134

I wore it for a week then decided this had to go back. As much as I liked this, it was just too uncomfortable. The prongs stick out a lot and goes all the way around which pokes the sides of your fingers. I tried to deal with the discomfort but by the 5th or 6th day, I was soo ready to return it.

17662,5,A3GGSBCYP870B8,B000NGJ41W,"These rings are perfect! I bought these because I lost a stone from my wedding band and I wanted to replace it, so now I have one to replace it and one to wear as an anniversary band and another as a back up! Ther fit true to size and are wonderful. Good buy :)","12 1, 2011",5812,817
17663,4,AWNYFSTWH3PO5,B000NGJ41W,"The rings are pretty but as a few other people mentioned, not the most comfortable. I like the fact that you can wear one or all three, the only problem while wearing all three is there's gaps between the rings (they don't stack tightly) and seem to come apart. For this reason I prefer to wear one on my thumb, looks cool and keeps the ring from rubbing on the other fingers. I cannot imagine wearing these on a middle finger, ouch. They are well made (hence the 4 stars) and hopefully the little CZ's won't fall out as they have done in other rings I've purchased elsewhere and had to return.","11 21, 2011",897,113
17664,5,A3B39VOPLT0CHQ,B000NGJ41W,These rings are amazing!!They look amazing and they really sparkle..I am so glad that I bought these and they will be rings that I will continue to wear!!,"11 16, 2011",9827,967
17665,5,A1O4AZLYNLTTP8,B000NGJ41W,"After an extensive search, I found these to be the best price. When I received them, I was very pleased. They are true to size, and, despite having stones all the way around, they are comfortable. The center band is very slightly wider than the other two, which gives the set interest. However, I was basically looking for two little bands to stack before and after a white gold and mixed gemstone ring I received as a birthday present and these are *perfect*.","11 14, 2011",2379,77
17666,4,A217AHWVVVTV5P,B000NGJ41W,"While I agree with everyone else that it's a beautiful ring set and that you can't tell their not real, I noticed that after a month or 2 they went from fitting perfectly to becoming a little big/loose on my finger...Maybe it's just me and my set of rings or someting...I can still wear them, it's just not as perfect a fit as before...Certinly not something to send in and get a different size...","11 8, 2011",15864,644
17667,5,A3NMZ8OBRH242H,B000NGJ41W,I bought these to serve as wedding bands and they are beautiful. The stackable effect is so pretty and the way the cz's shine makes them look expensive!,"11 4, 2011",10745,602
